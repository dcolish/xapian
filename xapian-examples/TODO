TODO list for examples
======================


general

	* make installable, and make install and build instructions
	  consistent with those in the main library introduction.

	* remove "common" from include search path, and make things still
	  work.

querygui

	* give a nice message if can't find .glade file, explaining that it
	  needs to have the path specified.
