This directory contains example programs which can be compiled against
Muscat.

If you haven't installed Muscat when configuring this directory, you need
to specify the location of the Muscat code, using the --with-libomus-uninst
configure option.

This is further complicated if you are performing a VPATH build
(ie, builddir != srcdir), in which case you must also specify the
location of a built, but not installed, Muscat library, using the
--with-libomus-uninst-exec configure option.

Note that you shouldn't specify relative directories in the
--with-libomus-uninst* parameters.

Once configure has run successfully, simply running "make" in the top-level
directory should build the examples.  Note that the "ferretfx" example is
currently disabled, and won't compile.
