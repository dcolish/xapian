This directory contains example programs which can be compiled against
Xapian.  These programs are intended to be a good starting point for those
trying to get acquainted with the Xapian API.

Run "./configure" to configure the examples, then run "make" to build them
all.  They can be installed by running "make install" (as root unless you
run configure with a --prefix argument).
