This directory contains example programs which can be compiled against
Muscat.

Due to the lack of a proper API, Muscat should currently not be installed.
The makefiles in this directory therefore expect to find libom and the
needed header files in the directory tree for Muscat, in the path ../om
relative to this directory.  ie: the examples directory should be placed
in the same directory as the om directory.

This will be fixed at a later date.
