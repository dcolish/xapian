This directory contains example programs which can be compiled against
Muscat.

Due to the lack of a proper API, Muscat should currently not be installed.
Therefore, when configuring this directory, you need to specify the
location of a built, but not installed, Muscat library.

This is further complicated if you are performing a VPATH build
(ie, builddir != srcdir), in which case you must also specify

Note that you shouldn't specify relative directories in this environment
variable, or in the --with-libomus-uninst* parameters

Here's the way I get this compiled and working:

Check out om and examples within the same directory. Within this directory:

mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
mkdir om
cd om
../../om/buildall
cd ..
mkdir examples
cd examples
../../examples/buildall --with-libomus-uninst=`pwd`/../../om --with-libomus-uninst-exec=`pwd`/../om
