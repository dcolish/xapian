Basic instructions:
===================

1.      Use omindex to build an index of your website:

$ ./omindex DBPATH WEBPATH /

Where DBPATH is where you want the database, such as
/home/myuser/omega/dbs/default and WEBPATH is the directory containing
all your web documents.

2.      Edit omega.cc so db_dir points to the directory containing
your database, such as /home/myuser/omega/dbs. 

3.      Edit query.cc so the format directory points to wherever you've
dropped the templates/ directory from omega, such as
/home/myuser/omega/templates.

4.      Rebuild omega.

5.      Test omega, from the command line:

$ ./omega
omega - om-examples 0.4.1-cvs (compiled Jun 25 2001 14:55:21)
Enter NAME=VALUE lines, end with blank line
HITSPERPAGE=10
P=my search terms


You then get a large-ish HTML file. For best results, set this all up
as a CGI in some way.
