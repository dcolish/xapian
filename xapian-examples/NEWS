Xapian-examples 0.8.0 (2004-04-19):

* delve: `delve -v DATABASE' now reports the number of terms.

* Added or improved the short description of each example at the top of
  its source file.

* Replaced the rather peculiar msearch with quest - a simpler command line
  search program which uses Xapian::QueryParser.

* simpleindex: We were ignoring the last paragraph if it had no trailing \n
  - fixed (bug#24).
