README for Xapian/Visual C++ Tools
==================================
2007-06-15 

Make files, some extra headers and associated tools for compiling Xapian on
Win32 using the Microsoft Visual C++ compilers. This is particularly useful
if you're using the Python for Windows binary distribution as this is also
compiled with Visual C++; otherwise the only way to make the Python
bindings work is to recompile Python with Cygwin (Xapian compiles happily
with Cygwin as standard).

The project was started by Ulrik Petersen, and continued by Charlie Hull of
Lemur Consulting who is now maintaining it. 

If you have any feedback, bug reports or comments about these files,
please DO NOT contact Ulrik, but please contact us at Lemur Consulting

What works?
===========

- The Python & PHP bindings
- The quartz binaries quartzcheck, quartzcompact, quartzdump
- The xapian-compact binary
- The Xapian example binaries
- The libtest.lib and libbtreecheck libraries
- The various tests that use the above, which are run as part of the makefile
  in tests/
- Omega, Omindex and Scriptindex (although these may have difficulty parsing
  Windows directory paths).

What doesn't work?
==================

- Any other bindings.

- Warning: unlike Unix, windows does not usually allow open files to be
  deleted.  This caused a serious problem with releases of Xapian on
  Windows before version 0.9.10, potentially leading to database
  corruption.  This is believed to be fixed in version 0.9.10, but there
  remains a restriction that you must close databases before deleting the
  folder (and the files in the folder) containing the database.  We do not
  expect this restriction to be lifted in future releases - equally, we do
  not expect it to cause serious problems.

Other bindings

How do I get the released sources?
==================================

You will need an archive tool which can uncompress .zip and .tgz archives.
A free tool which is suitable for this purpose is available from
http://www.7-zip.org/. 

1. Download and unpack Xapian, the Xapian bindings and Omega to the same
   folder. You should have a structure like this (the top level folder
   doesn't have to be called 'xapian'):

xapian\
xapian\xapian-core-0.x.y
xapian\xapian-bindings-0.x.y
xapian\omega-0.x.y

where x and y are revision numbers.

2. Download win32.zip for the appropriate Xapian release from Lemur
   Consulting and place in xapian\xapian-core-0.x.y.
3. Extract the files to the win32/ folder (usually, right click on the ZIP
   file and select Extract Here). 
4. IMPORTANT - Edit config.mak to make sure the various individual mak
   files end up in the right folders, and add the correct paths for any
   other binding languages. You may also need to edit the
   win32_applications_omega.mak and win32_bindings_python.mak files, and
   the .mak files for any other bindings. Note that all the .mak files in
   the win32/ folder are automatically copied to the correct places at the
   beginning of the build process, so edit them here rather than where they
   end up.

How do I get the latest development sources?
============================================

The development sources are held in a revision control system called
subversion, so you will first need a subversion client installed to build
the latest development sources.  Details of how to access the xapian
repository are available at http://xapian.org/bleeding.php

When you check out the xapian sources, you will have a slightly different
structure than that derived from the release tarballs:

xapian\xapian-core
xapian\xapian-bindings
xapian\xapian-applications
xapian\xapian-maintainer-tools

After checking out the sources, copy the contents of the
"xapian\xapian-maintainer-tools\win32msvc" directory to a new directory named
"xapian\xapian-core\win32". Run the build from this latter directory.

You will then need to edit "xapian\xapian-core\win32\config.mak" as
described in step 4 in the previous section ("How do I get the released
sources?").

What do I need to compile it?
=============================

You will need:

- Windows 2000 or later (NT-based; 95/98/ME won't work)

- Visual C++ 7.0 (.Net 2003/2005). In particular:
  - cl.exe
  - link.exe
  - lib.exe
  - nmake.exe

  OR...
  
- You can also compile with 
Visual C++ Express Edition available free from:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx 

In this case you'll also need the Platforms SDK:
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/
which contains headers, libs and NMAKE. Make sure once you have installed this that you create LIB and INCLUDE environment variables to point to the appropriate Platform SDK folders, and that the path to the SDK's BIN folder is in your PATH.

- Perl is used to pre-build some of the source files. Install a Win32 binary from ActiveState (http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/) and modify config.mak appropriately (PERL_DIR)

- You will also need the ZLIB library. If you download and run the binary Windows installer from:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617&package_id=16861
(it will be called zlib-X.Y.Z.exe, we have successfully used zlib-1.2.3.exe), and use the default settings, the path
to ZLIB will be the same as the default in config.mak (ZLIB_DIR).

- SWIG can be useful for recompiling the bindings, but this is done by the Xapian
core maintainers, so you shouldn't need to do this unless you are building from the development sources, in which 
case use the latest development version of SWIG (the latest Windows binary, 1.3.31, is not suitable).

- To compile the Python bindings you need Python from www.python.org. Make sure the paths to this are set correctly in config.mak.

- To compile the PHP bindings you need:

  a. the PHP sources from www.php.net (we have used PHP 4.4.6 & 5.2.1). 
  b. the built sources from a Windows binary distribution
  c. to edit config.mak to use the correct paths to PHP and to select the right version of PHP to build.

How do I compile it?
====================

1a) Run vcvars32.bat or equivalent for the C compiler. This may be listed as 'Command Prompt' in the Programs menu entry.
This will set up the appropriate paths. 

--OR--

1b) Make sure you have the appropriate paths set up for your Visual C++ compiler. 

To build the Xapian core:

2) cd to xapian-core-0.x.y\win32 or the appropriate path on your system.
3) edit config.mak to suit your environment
4) nmake CLEAN
either:
5a) nmake CHECK 
   - to build and run the test suite
5b) nmake 
   - to just build.

To build the bindings (do steps 1-5 above first to make sure you have Xapian built):
   
6) cd to xapian-core-0.x.y\win32 or the appropriate path on your system.
7) edit win32_bindings_python.mak or win32_bindings_php.mak to suit your environment (XAPIAN_CORE_REL_PYTHON or similar)
8) nmake COPYMAKFILES 
   - to make sure this change is copied to the build folder
9) cd to ..\..\xapian-bindings-0.x.y\python or ..\..\xapian-bindings-0.x.y\php
10) nmake CLEAN
11a) nmake CHECK 
   - to build and run the test suite
11b) nmake 
   - to just build.

To build Omega (do steps 1-5 above first to make sure you have Xapian built):

12) edit win32_applications_omega.mak to suit your environment (XAPIAN_CORE_REL_OMEGA)
13) nmake COPYMAKFILES 
   - to make sure this change is copied to the build folder
14) cd to ..\..\omega-0.x.y
15) nmake 
   - to build.

The binaries end up in xapian-core-0.x.y\win32\Release or \Debug if you are building a Debug build (see below)

Debug builds
===========

To compile Debug builds, run the build process with the following switch:

nmake DEBUG=1

This affects some lines in config.mak.

It is also possible to manually create a project in the Visual C++ Express Edition IDE.
