	* pr.c: modified line 89 to put quotes round Win32 paths that may
	  include spaces.
	* main.c: added section starting at line 444 to make sure we add
	  in the INCLUDE environment variable when using MSVC.

	* def.h: Redefined BUFSIZ to override the stdio.h value of 512 -
	  this should reduce likelihood of overflow problems.
