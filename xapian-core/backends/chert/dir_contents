<Description>
Chert is the development backend in the Xapian 1.1.x series.
It uses a custom written Btree management system to store
posting lists and termlists.  This is a highly efficient
backend, using compression to store the postlists, and supporting the
full range of indexing functionality (positional information, transactions,
etc).
