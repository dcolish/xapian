<Directory>backends/inmemory</Directory>

<Description>
This backend stores a database entirely in memory.

When the database is opened, the contents are generated by indexing from
a set of files, and when the database is closed these indexed contents are
lost.

This is useful for searching through relatively small amounts of data
(such as a single large file) which hasn't previously been indexed.

Together with access methods for dumping the contents of the index, it will
also provide a useful method of performing indexing efficiently: data would
be indexed to an InMemory database, which would periodically be flushed
into a database held in permanent storage.
