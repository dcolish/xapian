Implement move_to_chunk_containing() - treating first block as a special case.

Implement move_to(document) - skip to, but allows to move backwards.

Implement add_entry(), initially only allowing entry to be added at end (which
involves writing to the end of the last chunk, and also modifying the entry
count in the first chunk.  Last and first chunk might be the same - but
get_or_make_tag() should return the same tag then so this should work
transparently (as long as you don't assume that pos and end are still valid
after modifying either chunk.)
