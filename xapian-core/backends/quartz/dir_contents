<Description>
This backend uses a custom written Btree management system to store
posting lists and termlists.  This is a reasonably efficient
backend, using compression to store the postlists.  Positional
information is supported, but transactions aren't.  Quartz is
currently the default backend, but once Flint stabilises that will
become the default and Quartz will be deprecated and eventually
retired.
