/* DA files
 * --------
 * Functions for handling DA record and DA term files:
 * 
 * struct DA_file *     DA_open(const char * s, int type, int heavy_duty)
 * void                 DA_close(struct DAfile * p)
 * 
 * To open DA record and/or DA term files for example:
 * 
 *         struct DA_file * DA_r;
 *         struct DA_file * DA_t;
 *         DA_r = DA_open("/home/richard/test/d/R", DA_RECS, FLIMSY);
 *         DA_t = DA_open("/home/richard/test/d/T", DA_TERMS, FLIMSY);
 * 
 * The 3rd argument is either FLIMSY or HEAVY_DUTY - values 0 and 1.
 * 
 * And to close:
 * 
 *         DA_close(DA_r); DA_close(DA_t);
 * 
 * The total number of documents (or terms) in the DA file is given
 * by
 * 
 *         DA_r->itemcount       (DA_t->itemcount)
 * 
 * DA term access:
 * ---------------
 * The procedures defined as extern are:
 * 
 * int  DA_term(byte * k, struct DA_term_info * t, struct DA_file * p)
 * struct DA_postings *
 *      DA_open_postings(struct DA_terminfo * t, struct DA_file * p)
 * void DA_read_postings(struct DA_postings * q, int style, int Z)
 * void DA_close_postings(struct DA_postings * q)
 * int  DA_get_record(struct DA_file * p, int n, struct record * r)
 * int  DA_get_termvec(struct DA_file * p, int n, struct termvec * tv)
 * 
 * To look up a term k in DA_t using a DA_term_info structure:
 * 
 *        struct DA_term_info * t;
 *        found = DA_term(k, &t, DA_t);   // k is a k-sting of course
 * 
 * 'found' is 1 if found, 0 if not found.
 * 
 * [If not found 'DAterminfo' is filled in with info about the 'nearest'
 * term, but we won't be concerned with this case.]
 * 
 * t->freq is the term frequency. Immediately following a DAterm call, t
 * can be used to open a posting list:
 * 
 *        string DA_postings * q;
 *        q = DA_open_postings(&t, DA_t);
 * 
 * (thereafter t can be reused to look for other terms), and read from with
 * 
 *        DA_read_postings(q, style, Z);
 * 
 * If style == 0 each call delivers a doc number in q->Doc and a wdf number in
 * q->wdf. Termination occurs when q->Doc == MAXINT, after which MAXINT is
 * repeatedly delivered. Z == 0 usually, but skipping forward can be done by
 * setting Z > 0. Then the next q->Doc to be delivered will be the first one >=
 * Z.
 * 
 * If style == 1, doc numbers are delivered back in ranges:
 * 
 *       q->Doc to q->E  (with a common q->wdf)
 * 
 * Z is correctly interpreted, so if the next range was 100 to 200 and the call
 * was DA_read_postings(q, 1, 137), q->Doc would be 137 and q->E 200.
 * 
 * styles 0 and 1 can't be mixed in successive calls.
 * 
 * Finally close with
 * 
 *     DA_close_postings(q)
 * 
 * (you can close before hitting MAXINT.)
 * 
 *     [This bracketed section is coded but not compiled up. Once a term has
 *      been found:
 * 
 *            struct DA_term_info * t;
 *            found = DA_term(k, d, &t, DA_t);
 * 
 *      The next/previous term can be put into t with the calls
 * 
 *            found = DA_next_term(&t, DA_t);
 *            found = DA_prev_term(&t, DA_t);
 * 
 *      found is 0 when we hit the end/beginning of the term list. t->term
 *      gives the term (as a k-string) and t->freq gives its frequency.]
 * 
 * DA record access:
 * -----------------
 * 
 * The procedures defines as extern are
 * 
 * int DA_get_record(struct DA_file * p, int n, struct record * r)
 * int DA_get_termvec(struct DA_file * p, int n, struct termvec * tv)
 * 
 * To get records 148, 241 in turn, do this:
 * 
 *     record * r = M_make_record();
 *     found = DA_get_record(DA_r, 148, r); // record is at r->p
 *     ...
 *     found = DA_get_record(DA_r, 241, r); // record is at r->p
 *     ...
 *     M_lose_record(r);
 * 
 * found is true/false according as found/not found. r keeps a single buffer for
 * the record read, so the second DA_get_record overwrites the first.
 * 
 * To get the records together:
 * 
 *     record * r1 = M_make_record();
 *     record * r2 = M_make_record();
 *     found = DA_get_record(DA_r, 148, r1); // record is at r1->p
 *     ...
 *     found = DA_get_record(DA_r, 241, r2); // record is at r2->p
 *     ...
 *     M_lose_record(r1); M_lose_record(r2);
 * 
 * Exactly the same principle applies to termvecs:
 * 
 *     termvec * tv = M_make_termvec();
 *     found = DA_get_termvec(DA_r, 148, tv);
 *     ...
 *     found = DA_get_termvec(DA_r, 241, tv);
 *     ...
 *     M_lose_termvec(tv);
 * 
 * or
 * 
 *     termvec * tv1 = M_make_termvec();
 *     termvec * tv2 = M_make_termvec();
 *     found = DA_get_termvec(DA_r, 148, tv1);
 *     ...
 *     found = DA_get_termvec(DA_r, 241, tv2);
 *     ...
 *     M_lose_termvec(tv1); M_lose_termvec(tv2);
 * 
 * A termvec can be read sequentially with
 * 
 *     M_open_terms(tv);
 *     M_read_terms(tv); M_read_terms(tv);
