<Directory>backends/da</Directory>

<Description>
This directory contains the DA backend, used to access (old-style)
Direct Access databases.

This backend only supports reading from the database: databases
can be created with the old Muscat 3.6 software.  We do not plan
to implement writing to these databases, since they are a legacy
format and do not have the ability to represent several of the
data structures we require for some of our new features.
