<Directory>backends</Directory>

<Description>
This directory contains a subdirectory for each of the available database
backends.  Each backend corresponds to a different underlying file
structure.  For example, the DA backend corresponds to (old-style)
Direct Access databases, the inmemory backend holds its databases
entirely in RAM, and the quartz backend is a fully featured disk based
backend.

The directory also contains the implementation of DatabaseBuilder
which creates and opens instances of each type of database, encapsulating
the differences between backends.
