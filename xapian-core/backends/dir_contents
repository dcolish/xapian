<Directory>backends</Directory>

<Description>
This directory contains a subdirectory for each of the available database
backends.  Each backend corresponds to a different underlying file
structure.  For example, the DA backend corresponds to (old-style)
Direct Access databases and the sleepycat backend corresponds to (the
currently highly experimental) sleepycat based backend.

The directory also contains the implementation of DatabaseBuilder
which creates and opens instances of each type of database, encapsulating
the differences between backends.
