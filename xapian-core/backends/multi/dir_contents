<Directory>backends/multi</Directory>

<Description>
This directory contains the MultiDatabase backend, which enables
searches to be performed across several databases.  Opening this
database involves opening each of the sub-databases and merging
them together.

Searches are performed across the sub-databases via MultiPostList
and MultiTermList objects, which represent merged sets of postlist
and termlist objects.

This is probably not the most efficient way to perform these searches,
but works well enough for the moment.  It is expected that the
implementation of distributed searching will render this largely
obselete.

There is also considerable scope for further optimisation of this
backend, but this is not considered a priority since it is not expected
to persist in its current form.
