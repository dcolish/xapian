This file contains items which need to be worked on.


ToDo items on the coding side.  (Not a complete list)

Near term
=========

Split database definition files into database/postlist/termlist files.

Remove hardcoded reference to an indexer in InMemoryDatabase.  Index to it
in the usual way.

Make InMemoryDatabase allow (size of position vector) != (wdf), ie, if posting
is made and position is already there, leave position vector same but
increment wdf.

Allow for a non-zero minimum value for the ndl (normalised doc len).

Rename some methods to use consistent nomenclature: eg
get_termfreq -> get_cfreq (cf - collection frequency)

Expose positional information in postlists in a consistent way.
(extra methods / get_positionlist() method ?)

Implement phrase searching. - AND postlist, scan through positionlist
for sequential positions.

Document how each function should work in database, and what it should do in
error conditions (when things should be Asserted / when exceptions should
be thrown / when error condition should be returned.)
Do same for postlists, termlists, documents, matcher, etc.

Middle term
===========

A couple of objects get copied a lot - look into doing copy-on-write for them.
(Notably term objects (currently strings so this happens, but may not stay
that way) and ExpandBits)

Write more decision functions to expand - especially one to exclude the
current query terms.

Write an Enquire object to make a consistent exported searching interface.

Make the sleepycat database function (at all).
Write indexing methods for databases.

Passage retrieval.

Other search functions (collapse, sort, cluster).

Write (speed) performance test suite.

Sanify and implement introspection methods - get_database_path, etc.
Should be able to get entire state of database by introspection.
Extend introspection methods to cover all objects.

Long term
=========

Write indexer modules.

Make backends / weighting schemes / indexer modules register themselves
automatically.  At runtime / linktime?
(ie, replace current conditional compilation scheme)

Distributed searching (distributed enquire objects).
