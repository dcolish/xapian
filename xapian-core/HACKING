Instructions for Hacking on Muscat
==================================

This file is aimed to help developers get started with working on
Muscat.

Extra options to give to configure:
=============================

Note: Non-developer configure options are described in INSTALL

--enable-debug=paranoid
--enable-debug=full
	You should use one of these if you're going to be developing muscat.
	"paranoid" enables expensive consistency checks in various places in
	the code.
	"full" enables the compiling of code to generate verbose debugging
	messages.

Building from CVS:
==================

The CVS repository does not contain any automatically generated files
(such as configure and Makefile.in's).  Because of this, you need to run
several programs to build these files, before you can run the normal
build process.

At the time of writing, these programs are autoconf, libtool and automake.
Some older versions of these programs may not work correctly: at the
time of writing, the versions known to work are:
	automake (GNU automake) 1.4
	Autoconf version 2.13
	ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 1.3.3
Please tell us if you find that older (or newer) versions work or fail to work.

We have provided a simple standard script to run these programs for you:
simply run ${source-directory}/buildall, in the same way you would normally
run configure.
Arguments passed to buildall are in turn passed on to configure.

You may need to add extra macro directories to the path searched by aclocal
(which is part of autoconf) - you may do this by specifying these in the
ACLOCAL_FLAGS environment variable.

See "buildall --help" for more information.
