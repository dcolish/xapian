<h1>Installing Xapian</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document is intended to give a quick guide to how to install Xapian.
You can find more detailed instructions in the <code>INSTALL</code> file
which is in top level directory of each source tree.
</p>

<p>
Xapian can be built on UNIX systems (including MacOS X), and also Microsoft
Windows systems using GCC with mingw or cygwin, or MSVC.
</p>

<h2>Packaged binary versions</h2>

<p>
Pre-built Xapian packages are available for a number of platforms, notably most
of the popular Linux distributions and BSD variants, and also Cygwin and MSVC.
If you are using such a platform, you'll probably find it easiest to use
pre-built packages - it saves having to compile by hand and you'll generally
get updates automatically.
</p>

<p>
There are some links on our
<a href="http://www.xapian.org/download.php">download page</a> but it's likely
that Xapian packages are available for platforms we aren't aware of.  Feel
free to let us know and we'll add a link.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the version packaged may be rather old, in which case you can
either request the packager to update, or build from source.  If you find we're
linking to a package which isn't being updated, please let us know so we can
remove the link.
</p>

<h2>Installing from Source</h2>

<H3>Download</H3>
The first step is to obtain a copy of the software from the
<a href="http://www.xapian.org/download.php">Xapian website</a>.

<H3>Unpacking</H3>
Use the usual tools to unpack the archives.  For example, on a Linux system:
<blockquote> <code>
tar zxvf xapian-core-&lt;versionnumber&gt;<!-- -&lt;date&gt;-->.tar.gz
<br>
tar zxvf xapian-omega-&lt;versionnumber&gt;<!-- -&lt;date&gt;-->.tar.gz
</code> </blockquote>
These commands should unpack the archives into separate subdirectories
("xapian-core-N.N.N" and "xapian-omega-N.N.N").

<H3>Configuring and building Xapian</H3>

Xapian uses the GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool tools.
If you only wish to build
releases or <a href="http://www.oligarchy.co.uk/xapian/trunk/">SVN snapshots</a>
or make minor alterations, this need not concern you greatly.
<p>
These tools generate a shell script called "configure" for each of the
archives, which you should run to set up the code for compilation.

<p>
A typical build would be done using the commands:
<pre>
    cd xapian-core
    ./configure
    make
    make install
</pre>

Various options may be given to the configure script:
<code>./configure&nbsp;--help</code> summarises these.
<!-- see the installation documentation within the archive for more details. -->
<p>
By default, Xapian will be installed in directories under
<CODE>/usr/local</CODE>.  This can be altered using the --prefix option
to configure (e.g. <code>./configure --prefix=/home/fred/xapian</code> if
you don't have root access to the system you want to install Xapian on).

<H3>Configuring and building Omega</H3>
Omega can be built in almost exactly the same way as the core library.
Simply run:
<pre>
    cd xapian-omega
    ./configure
    make
</pre>
<p>
<CODE>configure</CODE> should automatically find the installed Xapian
library: if it doesn't you may need to specify the path to the
<CODE>xapian-config</CODE> script, by passing a value for
<CODE>XAPIAN_CONFIG</CODE> to configure, e.g. <CODE>./configure&nbsp;XAPIAN_CONFIG=/home/fred/xapian/bin/xapian-config</CODE>
<p>
Note: if you use libtool to link your application, you can link them with an
uninstalled Xapian library.  If you don't use libtool, you must install
Xapian.  We recommend using libtool anyway, since it handles setting the
runtime library search path when required, so you can link against a shared
Xapian library installed in a non-standard location, and it will be found
without you having to mess with LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

<H3>Building from SVN</H3>

If you wish to help develop Xapian, you may wish to

repository</A>.
