<H1>Xapian - the open source search engine</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

This document is intended to get you going with Xapian, taking you from the
point of downloading the code, to getting an example application compiled
and running.
<p>
Xapian can be built on UNIX systems (including MacOS X), and also Microsoft
Windows systems using GCC with mingw or cygwin.

<H3>Download</H3>
The first step is to obtain a copy of the software from the
<a href="http://www.xapian.org/download.php">Xapian website</a>.

<H3>Unpacking</H3>
Use the usual tools to unpack the archives.  For example, on a Linux system:
<blockquote> <code>
tar zxvf xapian-core-&lt;versionnumber&gt;<!-- -&lt;date&gt;-->.tar.gz
<br>
tar zxvf xapian-omega-&lt;versionnumber&gt;<!-- -&lt;date&gt;-->.tar.gz
</code> </blockquote>
These commands should unpack the archives into separate subdirectories
("xapian-core-N.N.N" and "xapian-omega-N.N.N").

<H3>Configuring and building Xapian</H3>
Xapian uses the GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool tools.
If you only wish to build
releases or <a href="http://www.oligarchy.co.uk/xapian/trunk/">SVN snapshots</a>
or make minor alterations, this need not concern you greatly.
<p>
These tools generate a shell script called "configure" for each of the
archives, which you should run to set up the code for compilation.

<p>
A typical build would be done using the commands:
<pre>
    cd xapian-core
    ./configure
    make
    make install
</pre>

Various options may be given to the configure script:
<code>./configure&nbsp;--help</code> summarises these.
<!-- see the installation documentation within the archive for more details. -->
<p>
By default, Xapian will be installed in directories under
<CODE>/usr/local</CODE>.  This can be altered using the --prefix option
to configure (e.g. <code>./configure --prefix=/home/fred/xapian</code> if
you don't have root access to the system you want to install Xapian on).

<H3>Configuring and building Omega</H3>
Omega can be built in almost exactly the same way as the core library.
Simply run:
<pre>
    cd xapian-omega
    ./configure
    make
</pre>
<p>
<CODE>configure</CODE> should automatically find the installed Xapian
library: if it doesn't you may need to specify the path to the
<CODE>xapian-config</CODE> script, by passing a value for
<CODE>XAPIAN_CONFIG</CODE> to configure, e.g. <CODE>./configure&nbsp;XAPIAN_CONFIG=/home/fred/xapian/bin/xapian-config</CODE>
<p>
Note: if you use libtool to link your application, you can link them with an
uninstalled Xapian library.  If you don't use libtool, you must install
Xapian.  We recommend using libtool anyway, since it handles setting the
runtime library search path, so you can link against a shared Xapian library
installed in a non-standard location, and it will be found without you having
to mess with LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

<H3>Building from SVN</H3>
