<H1>Matcher Design Notes</H1>

<P>This document is incomplete at present.  It lacks explanation of the min-heap
used to keep the best N M-set items (Managing Gigabytes describes this
technique well), the check() method isn't discussed, and probably some other
things.

<h2>The PostList Tree</h2>

<P>The QueryOptimiser class builds a tree structure of PostList objects
from the query.  At the leaf level, a PostList object is
created for each term, and for other leaf-level subqueries, like PostingSource
objects and value ranges.  Then pairs or groups of PostLists are combined using
2-way or n-way branching tree elements for AND, OR, etc - these are virtual
PostLists whose class names reflect the operation (MultiAndPostList,
OrPostList, etc).  See below for a full list.

<h3>OR</h3>

<p>For a group of OR operations, each OrPostList has two children,
job).  The OR tree is built up in a similar way to how an optimal huffman code
is constructed, so the sub-PostLists with the fewest entries are furthest
down the tree, and those with most nearest the top (this is
more efficient than an n-ary tree in terms of the number of comparisons which
need to be performed, ignoring various optimisations which the matcher can
perform - it may actually be the case that a MultiOrPostList could do a better
job in practice though).

<p>OR is coded for maximum
efficiency when the right branch has fewer postings in than the left branch.

<P>
When an OR gets "at end", it autoprunes, replacing itself with the
branch that still has postings - see below for full details.

<h3>AND</h3>

<p>For a multi-way AND operation, we have MultiAndPostList, which tries the
sub-postlists in order from least frequent to most frequent (two-way AND
is handled the same way).  This will generally minimise the number of posting
list entries we read and maximises the size of each skip_to.

<P>
When one of a sub-trees of AND operations runs out, the sub-query will signal
"at end", and this causes the AND to signal "at end" too.

<p>
The OP_FILTER query operator is actually treated as AND in the postlist tree
- the boolean-ness is pushed down to the leaf query, where it is handled
by the Weight object.

<h3>Other operations</h3>

<p>The other operations also handle "at end" either like OR or AND
(for asymmetric operations like AND_MAYBE, which happens may depend which
branch has run out).

<h2>running the match</h2>

<P>
Once the tree is built, the matcher repeatedly asks
the root of the tree for the next matching document and compares it to
those in the proto-mset it maintains.  Once the proto-mset is of the desired
final size, the candidate needs to score more highly that the lowest scoring
document in the proto-mset (either by weight, or in sort order if sorting is
used) to be interesting.  If it is, the lowest scoring document is removed
(which is easy as we store the proto-mset as a min heap) and the candidate
is added.

<P>
When the matcher itself gets "at end" from the postlist tree, the match
process ends.

<P>
The matcher also passes the lowest weight currently needed make the proto-mset
into the tree, and each node may adjust this weight and pass it on to its
subtrees.  Each PostList can report a minimum weight it could contribute - so if
the left branch of an AND will always return a weight of 2 or more,
then if the whole AND needs to return at least 6, the right branch is
told it needs to return at least 4.

<P>
For example, an OR knows that if its left branch can
contribute at most a weight of 4 and its right branch at most 7, then if
the minimum weight is 8, only documents matching both branches are now
of interest so it mutates into an AND.  If the minimum weight is 6 it
changes into an AND_MAYBE (A AND_MAYBE B matches documents which which
match A, but B contributes to the weight - in most search engines query
syntax, that's expressed as `+A B').  See the "Operator Decay" section
below for full details of these mutations.  If the minimum weight needed is
12, no document is good enough, and the OR returns "end of list".

<h2>Phrase and near matching</h2>

<P>
The way phrase and near matching works is to perform an AND query for all the
terms, with a filter node in front which only returns documents whose
positional information fulfils the phrase requirements.

<P>Because checking the positional information can be quite costly compared
to matching postlist trees, we hoist the position check higher up the tree
in cases when the phrase operation is below an AND.  So A AND (B NEAR C)
will actually filter the results of (A AND B AND C) through a check for
B NEAR C, which means we never need to check positions for documents which
don't match A.

<h2>virtual postlist types</h2>

<P>There are several types of virtual PostList.  Each type can be treated as
boolean or probabilistic - the only difference is whether the weights are
ignored or not.  The types are:

<ul>
<li> OrPostList: returns documents which match either branch

<li> MultiAndPostList: returns documents which match all branches

<li> MultiXorPostList: returns documents which match an odd number of branches

<li> AndNotPostList: returns documents which match the left branch, but not the
 right (the weights of documents from the right branch are ignored).

<li> AndMaybePostList: returns documents which match the left branch - weights from
 documents also in the right branch are added in for the probabilistic case
 ("X ANDMAYBE Y" is what Altavista did for "+X Y").

<li> FIXME: this list is no longer complete...

</ul>

<p>[Note: You can use AndNotPostList to apply an inverted boolean filter to a
probabilistic query]

<p>There are two main optimisations which the best match performs: autoprune and
operator decay.

<h2>autoprune</h2>

<P>For example, if a branch in the match tree is "A OR B", when A runs out then
"A OR B" is replaced by "B".  Similar reductions occur for XOR, ANDNOT, and
ANDMAYBE (if the right branch runs out).  Other operators (AND, FILTER, and
ANDMAYBE (when the left branch runs out) simply return "at_end" and this is
dealt with somewhere further up the tree as appropriate.

<P>An autoprune is indicated by the next or skip_to method returning a pointer
to the PostList object to replace the postlist being read with.

<h2>operator decay</h2>

<P>The matcher tracks the minimum weight needed for a document to make it into
the m-set (this decreases monotonically as the m-set forms).  This can be
used to replace on boolean operator with a stricter one.  E.g. consider A OR
B - when maxweight(A) &lt; minweight and maxweight(B) &lt; minweight then only
documents matching both A and B can make it into the m-set so we can replace
the OR with an AND.  Operator decay is flagged using the same mechanism as
autoprune, by returning the replacement operator from next or skip_to.

<p>Possible decays:

<ul>
<li> OR -&gt; AND
<li> OR -&gt; ANDMAYBE
<li> ANDMAYBE -&gt; AND
<li> XOR -&gt; ANDNOT
</ul>

<p>A related optimisation is that the Match object may terminate early if
maxweight for the whole tree is less than the smallest weight in the mset.
