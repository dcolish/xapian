Xapian Internals
================

This page groups together the documentation of the internals of Xapian.
This is useful if you intend to modify Xapian, but if you just want to
use Xapian in your own code, see the `user documentation <./>`_ instead.

Use the navigation links above to find the information you want. Also,
see the "HACKING" file in the xapian-core source distribution.
