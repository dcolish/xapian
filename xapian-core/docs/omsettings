  The settings available for use in an OmSettings object are:

  - general
    - backend : database backend type - current backends are: auto, da, db,
      inmemory, remote, and quartz
    - database_create : boolean, true if a new database should be created.
      Default is false.
    - database_allow_overwrite : boolean.  This has no effect unless
      backend_create is true.  If this setting is true a new database will be
      created in place of an existing one.  If false, an exception will be
      thrown if there is an existing database in place.  Default is false.

  - auto pseudo-backend
    - auto_dir : directory for auto pseudo-backend to look for database in

  - muscat36 backends
    - m36_key_file : keys for DA or DB file
    - m36_record_file : DA record file
    - m36_term_file : DA term file
    - m36_db_file : DB file
    - m36_db_cache_size : size of DB file cache in blocks (default 30)
    - m36_heavyduty : true for 3 byte offset form, false for older 2 byte
      form.  Only used by da backend - db backend autodetects. (default true)

  - remote backend
    - remote_type : "prog" or "tcp"
    - remote_program : the name of the program to run to act as a server
   			 (when remote_type="prog")
    - remote_args : the arguments to the program named in remote_program
   			 (when remote_type="prog")
    - remote_server : the name of the host running a tcp server
   			 (when remote_type="tcp")
    - remote_port : the port on which the tcp server is running
   			 (when remote_type="tcp")
    - remote_timeout : The timeout in milliseconds used before assuming that
                       the remote server has failed.  If this timeout is
                       reached for any operation, then an OmNetworkTimeout
                       exception will be thrown.  The default if not
                       specified is 10000ms (ie 10 seconds)
    - remote_connect_timeout : The timeout in milliseconds used when
                       attempting to connect to a remote server.  If this
                       timeout is reached when attempting to connect, then
                       an OmNetworkTimeout exception wil be thrown.  The
                       default if not specified is to use the value of
                       remote_timeout.

  - quartz backend
    - quartz_dir : directory containing quartz database
    - quartz_logfile : the name of a file in which to log various Quartz
    			events to.

  - match options
    - match_collapse_key : key number to collapse on - duplicates mset
      entries will be removed based on a key (default -1 => no collapsing)
    - match_sort_forward : If true, documents with the same weight will
      be returned in ascending document order; if false, they will be
      returned in descending order.flag to sort forward (default true)
    - match_percent_cutoff : Minimum percentage score for returned
      documents. If a document has a lower percentage score than this, it
      will not appear in the mset.  If your intention is to return only
      matches which contain all the terms in the query, then consider using
      OmQuery::OP_AND instead of OmQuery::OP_OR in the query).
      (default -1 => no cut-off)
    - match_cutoff :  Minimum weight for a document to be returned.  If a
      document has a lower score that this, it will not appear in the mset.
      It is usually only possible to choose an appropriate weight for cutoff
      based on the results of a previous run of the same query; this is thus
      mainly useful for alerting operations.
    - match_weighting_scheme : Weighting scheme to use; this is one of
      'bm25', 'trad' or 'bool'.  The default is bm25.

  - match bias functor options - NB this is a temporary API for this feature.
    - match_bias : Default false - set to true to enable the match bias
      functor.
    - match_bias_weight : Maximum weight bias functor can add (and which is
      given to document with a time now or in the future) - default 10000.
    - match_bias_halflife - the match bias decays exponentially with time -
      this sets the half-life of this decay in seconds (default 2 days).
      
  - BM25 weighting options : The BM25 formula is \f[
      \frac{C.s_{q}}{1+L_{d}}+\sum_{t}\frac{(A+1)q_{t}}{A+q_{t}}.\frac{(B+1)f_{t,d}}{B((1-D)+DL_{d})+f_{t,d}}.w_{t}
    \f] where
    \f$w_{t}\f$ is the termweight of term t,
    \f$f_{t,d}\f$ is the within document frequency of term t in document d,
    \f$q_{t}\f$ is the within query frequency of term t,
    \f$L_{d}\f$ is the normalised length of document d,
    \f$s_{q}\f$ is the size of the query,
    and \f$A\f$, \f$B\f$, \f$C\f$ and \f$D\f$ are user specified parameters:
    - bm25weight_A : A parameter governing the importance of within query
                     frequency - any positive number, 0 being wqf not
                     used.  Default is 1.
    - bm25weight_B : A parameter governing the importance of within
                     document frequency - any positive number, 0 being wdf
                     not used.  Default is 1.
    - bm25weight_C : Size of compensation factor for the high wdf values
                     in large documents - any positive number, 0 being no
                     compensation.  Default is 0.
    - bm25weight_D : Relative importance of within document frequency and
                     document length - any number in range 0 to 1.  Default
                     is 0.5.
    - bm25weight_min_normlen : This specifies a cutoff on the minimum value
		     that can be used for a normalised document length: smaller
		     values will be forced up to this cutoff.  This prevents
		     very small documents getting a huge bonus weight.

  - traditional weighting scheme options : The traditional weighting formula
    is \f[
      \sum_{t}\frac{f_{t,d}}{k.L_{d}+f_{t,d}}.w_{t}
    \f] where
    \f$w_{t}\f$ is the termweight of term t,
    \f$f_{t,d}\f$ is the within document frequency of term t in document d,
    \f$L_{d}\f$ is the normalised length of document d,
    and \f$k\f$ is a user specifyable parameter:
    - tradweight_k : A parameter governing the importance of within
                     document frequency and document length - any positive
                     number, 0 being wdf and doc length not used.  Default
                     is 1.

  - expand options:
    - expand_use_query_terms : If false, terms already in the query will be
      not be returned in the ESet; if true, they can be. (default false)
    - expand_use_exact_termfreq : If true then term frequencies will be
      calculated exactly; if true, an approximation may be used which can
      greatly improve efficiency. The approximation only applies when
      multiple databases are searched together. (default false)
    - expand_k : value of k parameter used in expand
