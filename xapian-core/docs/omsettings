  The settings available for use in an OmSettings object are:

  - match options
    - match_collapse_key : key number to collapse on - duplicates mset
      entries will be removed based on a key (default -1 => no collapsing)
    - match_sort_forward : If true, documents with the same weight will
      be returned in ascending document order; if false, they will be
      returned in descending order.flag to sort forward (default true)
    - match_percent_cutoff : Minimum percentage score for returned
      documents. If a document has a lower percentage score than this, it
      will not appear in the mset.  If your intention is to return only
      matches which contain all the terms in the query, then consider using
      OmQuery::OP_AND instead of OmQuery::OP_OR in the query).
      (default -1 => no cut-off)
    - match_cutoff : Minimum weight for a document to be returned.  If a
      document has a lower score that this, it will not appear in the mset.
      It is usually only possible to choose an appropriate weight for cutoff
      based on the results of a previous run of the same query; this is thus
      mainly useful for alerting operations.

  - match_sort_key : value number to reorder on.  Sorting is with a string
      compare.  Higher is better.  If match_sort_key is set, but 
      match_sort_bands isn't, sort the whole mset my the key.  No default.
  - match_sort_bands : sort results into this many bands of equal percentage
      relevance.  Within each band, sort by the value number specified by
      match_sort_key, otherwise by document id (taking note of the setting of
      match_sort_forward.  The default (0) is off.

  - match bias functor options - NB this is a temporary API for this feature.
    - match_bias : Default false - set to true to enable the match bias
      functor.
    - match_bias_weight : Maximum weight bias functor can add (and which is
      given to document with a time now or in the future) - default 10000.
    - match_bias_halflife - the match bias decays exponentially with time -
      this sets the half-life of this decay in seconds (default 2 days).
