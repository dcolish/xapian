BM25
====

This is a technical note about the BM25 weighting scheme.  BM25 is the best
probabilistic weighting scheme as revealed in the TREC tests.

------------------

The Omsee 3.6 term weighting function is (in its most general form)

 (A + 1)q   (B + 1)f                  (r+0.5)(N-n-R+r+0.5)
 -------- . -------- w, where w = log --------------------    ...(1)
  (A + q)    BL + f                    (n-r+0.5)(R-r+0.5)

where A, B are constants

q is the wqf, the within query frequency,
f is the wdf, the within document frequency,
n,r,N,R you will know, and
L = 1 in Omsee 3.6, because we don't keep document lengths, but in Stephen
Robertson's formula is the normalised document length, i.e. the length
of the document divided by the average length of a document.

(The factors (A + 1), (B + 1) are unnecessary here, but help scale the
weights, so ((A+1)q)/(A+q) = 1 when q = 1 etc. But they are critical below.)


Stephen's BM11 is this formula for the term weights, but then he adds
an extra item to the sum of term weights to give the overall document
score. It is

        (1-L)
    C s -----                                               ...(2)
        (1+L)

where s is the size of the query (the number of terms in the query) and
C is yet another constant. Of course, this is zero when L = 1.

BM15 is BM11 with the B+f in place of BL+f in (1)

BM25 combines the two with a scaling factor, D, which turns BM15 into BM25 as
it moves from 0 to 1 :

 (A + 1)q   (B + 1)f
 -------- . -------- w                              ...(3)
  (A + q)     K + f

where K = B((1 - D ) + DL)

and instroduces another constant E, as a power to which f and K are raised,
i.e.

 (A + 1)q    (B + 1)f!E
 -------- . ----------- w                          ...(4)
  (A + q)    K!E + f!E

where a!b means a to the power b. (2) and (4) make up BM25, with which
Stephen has had so much recent success.

This all seems so ad-hoc, and there are so many unknown constants in the
formula, that my first response is one of some doubt. But note that with
L = 1 and E = 1 we get the Omsee 3.6 formula anyway. Our choice of L = 1 is
rational given the successful approach of Euroferret style indexing (index
every document with roughly the same number of terms), and Stephen
remarks that values of E other than 1 were 'not helpful'.
