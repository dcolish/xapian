<H1>Using the stemming algorithms</H1>

The stemming algorithms are designed to be part of our Omsee search engine,
but can also be used as standalone pieces of code.  They are implemented,
and have an interface in, the C programming language.

<H2>Using the English stemming algorithm</H2>

The function prototypes are:
<PRE>
    extern void * setup_english_stemmer();

    extern char * english_stem(void * z, char * q, int i0, int i1);

    extern void closedown_english_stemmer(void * z);
</PRE>

The stemming process is set up with a call of the type
<PRE>
    void * z = setup_english_stemmer();
</PRE>
and thereafter used with repeated calls of the type
<PRE>
    char * p = english_stem(z, q, i0, i1);
</PRE>
The word to be stemmed is in byte address q offsets i0 to i1 inclusive (i.e.
from q[i0] to q[i1]). i1 &lt; i0 is treated as i1 == i0. The stemmed result is
the C string at address p.
<P>
Finally the stemming process is closed down with
<PRE>
    closedown_english_stemmer(z);
</PRE>



For example,
<PRE>
    {
    	void * z = setup_english_stemmer();
	char * s;

	s = "advisability";
	printf("'%s' stems to '%s'\n",
	       s,
	       english_stem(z, s, 0, strlen(s) - 1));

	s = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";
	printf("'%s' stems to '%s'\n",
	       s,
	       english_stem(z, s, 0, strlen(s) - 1));

        closedown_english_stemmer(z);
    }
</PRE>

[This code hasn't been tested...]

<H2>Using the other stemming algorithms</H2>

The other stemming algorithms can be invoked by subsituting in
place of &quot;english&quot; above one of the words:
<UL><LI>
danish
</LI><LI>
dutch
</LI><LI>
french
</LI><LI>
german
</LI><LI>
italian
</LI><LI>
norwegian
</LI><LI>
portuguese
</LI><LI>
spanish
</LI><LI>
swedish
</LI></UL>

The 2 letter "ISO 639" language codes for the appropriate languages may
also be used.  Finally, for historical compatibility, the original porter
stemming algorithm may be selected by &quot;porter&quot;
<P>

For a general account of stemmers see the document on
<A HREF="stemming.html">writing stemming algorithms</A>.

<P>

For background on the English stemmer, see Porter's paper of 1980,
<A HREF="porterstem.html">An algorithm for suffix stripping</A>.

<H2>Text representation: letters and accents</H2>

We will probably move over to a Unicode reresentation of accented letters
in the future, so the scheme outlined below may be regarded as provisional.

(Note that, at present, the stemming algorithms are the only part of the
 Omsee search engine which has any dependence on character representation.)
<P>
The word to be be stemmed must be entirely in lower case.
<P>
Accents are represented as L^A where L is the letter and A the accent. This
is unusual, but very convenient.
<p>
    The full Omsee scheme for accents (just for the record) is as follows:

<pre>
       coding    common name                placing      occurs in:
       --------+--------------------------+------------+-------------
        ^a       Acute                       over        French etc
        ^b       Breve                       over        Rumanian
        ^c       Cedilla                     under       French
        ^d       Dot                         over        Hungarian
        ^g       Grave                       over        French etc
        ^h       circumflex (Hat)            over        French etc
        ^l       Left hook                   under       Polish
        ^m       Macron (line over a letter) over        Latvian
        ^n       No dot (over i or j)        over        ?
        ^o       circle (O-shape)            over        Danish etc
        ^q       double acute (Quote shape)  over        Hungarian
        ^r       Right hook                  under       Polish
        ^s       underline (underScore)      under       -
        ^t       Tilde                       over        Spanish etc
        ^u       diaeresis (Umlaut)          over        French etc
        ^v       hacek (V-shape)             over        Czech
        ^z       stroke through letter       through     Danish
</pre>

    Each language on the far right of this table supplies just one example.
    Thus hacek is used in Latvian, Lithuanian, Serbo-Croatian (using the
    Roman alphabet), Slovak and Slovene - as well as Czech.
<p>
    This list, to the best of our knowledge, covers all European languages
    that use the Roman alphabet.
<p>
In the code of the algorithm, significant accent combinations are translated
into certain upper case letters.
<p>
For example, French makes use of the accents ^a ^g ^u ^h and ^c, and there is
this mapping of letter-accent combinations to upper case letters:
<pre>
        A      a^h   (a circumflex)
        F      e^a   (e acute)
        G      e^g   (e grave)
        E      e^h   (e circumflex)
        I      i^h   (i circumflex)
        U      u^h   (u cicumflex)
        J      i^u   (i trema, or diaeresis)
</pre>
This table is declared in stem_french.c, with similar tables for the other
languages.
<p>
In German and Dutch accents are completely removed before the stemming
process begins.
<p>
In English there are no accents, and the issue is not addressed.
<p>
The mappings of a^h to A etc and back again are done at POINT A and POINT B,
as marked in stem_french.c. To escape from our unusual representation of
accents you may wish to recode this (and that is extremely easy when the
accented letters are represented by single byte characters.)
<p>
Similar adjustments may be made to the other algorithms.
<p>
Note that in the irregular_forms[] table words are given with the upper case
letters standing for accented letters, e.g.
<pre>
    "etr" ,
    "Etre/FtF/FtFe/FtFes/FtFs/Ftant/Ftante/Ftants/Ftantes/suis/es/"
    ....
</pre>
Here E stands for e-circumflex, and F for e-acute.


<H2>Vocabularies</H2>

Each stemmer is issued with a vocabulary in data/voc.txt, and its stemmed
form in data/voc.st0. You can use these for testing and evaluation purposes.
