<H1>Remote Backend</H1>

<P>This document describes how to make use of the facilities in Xapian
for distributed searches.

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>There are two sides to the distributed searching.  The client end is the
program initiating the search on behalf of a user, and the server end is
the program which provides a searching interface over a set of databases
for the client.  There can be many servers, with many clients sharing
them.  In theory, a server can also be a client to other servers, but
this may not be very useful or efficient.

<P>The client runs queries in the same way that it would on local databases,
but with different database arguments.  Instead of type, eg, "quartz",
use "remote".  The extra parameters describe how to connect to the server.
Once the database is opened, the query process is identical to any other.
Using a stub database with autobackend is a good way to wrap up access to
a remote database in a neat way.

<P>The remote backend currently support two client/server methods: prog and
tcp.  They both use the same protocol, although different means to contact
the server.

<H2>The Prog Method</H2>

<P>The prog method spawns a program when the database is opened, and
communicates with it over a Unix domain socket.  This isn't intended for
production use, but is useful for debugging and testing.  The omprogsrv
program, which is designed to be the program spawned, currently only uses
text files indexed into inmemory databases.

<P>From the client end, the following database parameters are used:

<ul>
<li> "remote_type" = "prog"

<li> "remote_program" - The program to be run, ie "omprogsrv", which is built in
            the netprogs directory in the xapian-core distribution.  If a full path
            isn't given, the PATH environment variable is used.

<li> "remote_args" - a string giving the arguments to the program.  In the
            case of omprogsrv, each argument is the name of a text file to be
            indexed into an inmemory database.  Any number can be specified.
</ul>

<h2>The TCP Method</h2>

<P>The tcp method uses TCP/IP sockets to connect to a running server on a remote
(or indeed local) machine.

<P>The client's database parameters are:

<ul>
<li> "remote_type" = "tcp"

<li> "remote_server" - The server's hostname.

<li> "remote_port" - The tcp port on the server to use.
</ul>

The server is omtcpsrv in the netprogs/ directory of the xapian-core distribution.
This should be started and left running in the background before searches
are performed.

<P>The arguments omtcpsrv currently knows are:
<dl>
<dt> --port PORTNUM
<dd>        (required) the port to listen on.
<dt>    --one-shot
<dd>        Handle one connection, and then exit.  If --one-shot is not used,
	then the server runs until it is killed manually.
<dt>    --idle-timeout MSECS
<dd>	Set the timeout on a idle connection.
<dt>    --active-timeout MSECS
<dd>	Set the timeout waiting for responses when the connection is active.
<dt>    --timeout MSECS
<dd>	Set the idle and active timeouts to the same value.
<dt>    --quiet
<dd>	Minimal output.
</dl>
One or more databases need to be specified by listing their directories - they
are opened using the "auto" pseudo-backend.

<P>Once started, the server will run and listen for connections on the
configured port, currently handling them one by one (although this will
change at some point).

<H2>Notes</H2>

<P>A remote search should behave just like the equivalent local one, with the
exception of a few currently unimplemented features (e.g. match decision
functors).

<P>Exceptions are propagated across the link and thrown again at the client end.
