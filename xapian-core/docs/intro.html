<H2>Introduction</H2>

This document is intended to get you going with Muscat, taking you from the
point of downloading the code, to getting an example application compiled
and running.
<p>
Note that Muscat is currently only available in versions targeted for UNIX
systems.

<H3>Download</H3>
The first step is to obtain a copy of the software.  Currently there are no
stable releases of Muscat, so for your first explorations we recommend using
one of the nightly snapshots.  These have been tested for consistency,
and compiled on our test system (though they may not compile on your system,
and may perform incorrectly even if they do).
<p>
Nightly snapshots are available via
<a href="http://open.muscat.com/open/developer/download/index.html">http://open.muscat.com/open/developer/download/index.html</a>
<p>
Snapshots of two different pieces of code are available: one will be named
<code>om-&lt;versionnumber&gt;-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz</code> and contains the
core code for the Muscat search engine.  The other will be named
<code>om-examples-&lt;versionnumber&gt;-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz</code> and
contains various example applications using Muscat.
<p>
You should retrieve the latest snapshot pair available; note that
if you wish to build the examples you should make sure that both snapshots
have the same date.  The snapshots are only released if they compile: thus
absence of an example snapshot probably means that recent changes in the
core code have broken the example snapshots.

<H3>Unpacking</H3>
Use the usual tools to unpack the archives.  For example, on a Linux system:
<blockquote> <code>
tar zxvf om-&lt;versionnumber&gt;-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz
<br>
tar zxvf om-examples-&lt;versionnumber&gt;-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz
</code> </blockquote>
The archives should then be unpacked into subdirectories of their own.
<P>

<H3>Configuring and building Muscat</H3>
Muscat uses the GNU automake and autoconf tools.  If you only wish to

<H3>Building from CVS</H3>
If you wish to help develop muscat, you may wish to build directly from the
CVS repository.  Note that this is extremely likely periodically to contain
severe bugs and code which will not compile.  Details on how to access
the CVS repository are available at
<a href="http://open.muscat.com/open/developer/download/cvs.html">http://open.muscat.com/open/developer/download/cvs.html</a>
<p>
The other drawback of CVS is that you will need to generate your own configure
script and makefiles.  This can be done using the GNU autoconf and automake
packages: you must have these installed if you wish to work from CVS.
<p>
We provide a useful script (<code>buildall</code>) to run all the necessary
scripts to generate the project Makefiles.
