ToDo items on the coding side.
(Not a complete list)

Near term (within a week)
=========================

Write proper weighting formula for termlists, so expand works correctly.
Write an Enquire object to make a consistent exported searching interface.
Make all databases inherit from IndexerDestination.
Add tags to all files so can add licences easily.
Expose positional information in postlists in a consistent way.
Implement phrase searching.

Middle term (within a month)
============================

Make the sleepycat database function (at all).
Passage retrieval.
Other search functions (collapse, sort, cluster).

Rename TextfileDatabase (to DynamicDatabase?) - indexer is all that is Textfile.
Make gui demo display text being searched.

Write (speed) performance test suite.

Long term
=========

Write indexer modules.
Distributed searching (distributed enquire objects).
