ToDo items on the coding side.
(Not a complete list)

Near term (within a fortnight)
=========================

Make Builder work when some access methods are configured off.

Split database definition files into database/postlist/termlist files.
Rename TextfileDatabase (to DynamicDatabase?) - indexer is all that is Textfile.
Remove old references to term_id_to_name() and term_name_to_id().
Sanify introspection methods - get_database_path, etc.
Write proper weighting formula for termlists, so expand works correctly.
Write an Enquire object to make a consistent exported searching interface.
Make all databases inherit from IndexerDestination.
Add tags to all files so can add licences easily.
Expose positional information in postlists in a consistent way.
Implement phrase searching.

Middle term (within a couple of months)
============================

Make the sleepycat database function (at all).
Passage retrieval.
Other search functions (collapse, sort, cluster).

Extend introspection methods to cover all objects.

Make gui demo display text being searched.

Write (speed) performance test suite.

Long term
=========

Write indexer modules.
Distributed searching (distributed enquire objects).
