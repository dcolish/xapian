<H1>Quickstart</H1>

<P>
This document contains sufficient information to enable you to build your
first application using Muscat.  It does not attempt to provide complete
coverage of all the features of Muscat: for that, see the accompanying
user manual and reference document.
</P><P>
The document consists of a walk-through development of a simple
application using the Muscat library, together with commentary on how
the application could be taken further.

<HR>
<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>
Before following the steps outlined in this document, you will need to have
the Muscat library installed on your system.
For instructions on obtaining and installing Muscat, read the
<A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> document.
</P>
<P>
You will also need a reasonably recent C++ compiler.  We currently use GCC
version 2.95.2, but any reasonably ANSI compilant C++ compiler should have
a decent chance of successfully compiling the code.
</P>

<HR>
<H2>The index</H2>

<P>
An information retrieval system using Muscat typically has two parts.  The
first part is the indexer, which takes documents in various formats,
processes them so that they can be efficiently searched, and stores the
processed documents in an appropriate data structure.  The second part
is the searcher, which takes queries and reads the index to return a list
of the documents relevant to each query.
</P>

<H3>The contents of an index</H3>

[This isn't required knowledge, but it is helpful to understand roughly what
the information which Muscat stores in an index consists of.]

<H3>Finding the Muscat library</H3>

<P>
A small utility, &quot;libomus-config&quot;, is installed along with Muscat
to assist you in finding the installed Muscat library, and in generating
the flags to pass to the compiler and linker to compile.  
</P><P>
After a successful compilation, this utility should be in your path, so
you can simply run
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>libomus-config --cflags</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
to determine the flags to pass to the compiler, and
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>libomus-config --libs</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
to determine the flags to pass to the linker.

These flags are returned on the utility's standard output (so you could use
backtick notation to include them on your command line).
</P><P>
If your project uses the GNU autoconf tool, you may also use the
<CODE>OM_PATH_LIBOMUS</CODE> macro, which is included as part of Muscat,
and will check for an installation of Muscat and set (and
<CODE>AC_SUBST</CODE>) the <CODE>LIBOMUS_CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>LIBOMUS_LIBS</CODE> variables to
be the flags to pass to the compiler and linker, respectively.

If you don't use GNU autoconf, don't worry about this.
</P>

<H3>Compiling the simple example</H3>
Once you know the compilation flags, compilation is a simple matter of
invoking the compiler!  For our example, we would
