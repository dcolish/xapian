Termid issue:  Where should translation from local id to global id be performed?

 i)  Could do in multitermlist / multipostlist - have a translation cache
 ii) Could do by passing lowlevel termlist a translation routine
     (NULL = no translation)

Asserts: should be put in place to ensure correct usage.  If the assert isn't
there, segfaults should not result, unless the condition is specifically
prohibited in documentation.  Segfaults should not result when reading from
files, or other data streams, even if Asserts are turned off.
