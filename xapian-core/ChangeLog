	* Started Changelog

	* Previous state of code:

	  o An API for searching has just been created, but is undocumented,
	    will change in various ways in the coming weeks, and isn't quite
	    implemented correctly when building queries containing more than
	    one term.

	  o Stemming algorithms for dutch, english, french, german, italian,
	    portuguese and spanish added and tested.

	  o Searching through DA databases, raw text files (with naive
	    indexer) and multiple databases implemented.

	  o Documentation in a reasonably sorry state.  Next week is
	    documentation week.
