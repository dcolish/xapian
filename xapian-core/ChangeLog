Thu Feb 10 18:53:33 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Added OmEnquire::get_matching_terms() to the API.

Thu Feb 10 18:02:37 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Added tests to apitest for the match and expand decision functors,
	  and added another shorthand function to reduce code duplication.

Thu Feb 10 16:04:45 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* More documentation in omenquire.h

	* Changed isnull to isdefined (note change of sense), since this makes
	  more sense, and is hopefully less likely to confuse.

Thu Feb 10 14:17:31 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Lots more documentation comments in omerror.h and omenquire.h

	* Added API calls to set decision functors for matcher - not yet
	  implemented, however.

Wed Feb  9 17:11:13 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Implemented far enough for it to compile.
	  (Doesn't calculate query length automatically)

Wed Feb  9 16:45:19 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Added calls to specify within query frequency, positional
	  information, and query length.  Not yet implemented.  (So, won't
	  compile.)

	* Can set boolean flag on a query directly.

	* Many documentation comments added to header files in include/

Wed Feb  9 16:42:08 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* stemtest.pl handling of random input data improved:

	  o doesn't bother regenerating the random data every time.

	  o the seed is actually generated from the hostname, rather
	    than being hard-coded to 1.

	  o support for running the test with a specified seed

	  o some basic tests that the output is sensible

Wed Feb  9 14:52:54 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Rename all exception classes to have names ending in Error

Wed Feb  9 14:48:48 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Added and implemented get_doc_data in OmEnquire

	* Now get msets and esets by return value rather than reference
	  argument.

Wed Feb  9 11:18:48 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Fixed the header guards (now all caps, should be unique, and don't
	  start with underscores).

Tue Feb  8 20:04:34 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Changed prefix OM to Om in all class names.

Tue Feb  8 19:17:53 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

        * Changed OMMSet::max_weight to OMMSet::max_possible.
          Added OMMSet::max_attained, which is weight of top match, (not
          neccessarily top item in MSet)

        * Allow user to specify decision function for expand.

        * Also allow user to specify that query terms should not be returned
          by expand, by calling OMExpandOptions::use_query_terms().                       This does not yet work, however.

        * Add many code comments, and make doc++ stuff work better.

Tue Feb  8 19:13:43 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Added some more tests.

Tue Feb  8 16:51:22 GMT 2000 Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Fixed boolean only querying.

	  o) Made isbool get set correctly (was being unset by
	    initialise_from_copy)

	  o) Set max_weight correctly.

Tue Feb  8 16:28:48 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Added the stemmer test script, stemtest.pl

Mon Feb  7 19:17:25 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Prefix all the types in omtypes.h with "om_".

Mon Feb  7 17:37:52 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Added a test of boolean-only queries to apitest, which fails.

Mon Feb  7 15:56:43 GMT 2000 Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Improved exception hierarchy:

	  o Exceptions are all split between `OmLogicError' and
	    `OmRuntimeError'.
	    
	  o Plain `OmError' exceptions are no longer allowed.

	  o All exception classes are prefixed with `Om'.

Mon Feb  7 12:57:12 GMT 2000 Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Make get_eset()'s max_items parameter work.
          (Changed max_esize in OMExpand from a member to a parameter of
	  expand() )

	* Implemented add_database() correctly in OMEnquire: can now do
	  multi database stuff.

Mon Feb  7 12:53:33 GMT 2000  Chris Emerson <chris.emerson@open.muscat.com>

	* Added tests to apitest for maxitems parameters and null queries

Mon Jan 31 17:00:18 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* OMMatch stores query in a pointer rather than the historical
	  remnants of a stack.
	  OMEnquire updated accordingly.

	* OMEnquire deallocates RSet correctly.

	* querygui example compiles and works.

Fri Jan 28 16:44:49 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Fixed problems with assigning to a query (old query elements were
	  left in place.)  Implemented automatic merging of OR and AND nodes
	  into a single list of terms to be ORed or ANDed.

Fri Jan 28 15:53:53 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Added introspection methods to OMQuery.

Fri Jan 28 13:41:20 GMT 2000  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@open.muscat.com>

	* Started Changelog

	* Previous state of code:

	  o An API for searching has just been created, but is undocumented,
	    will change in various ways in the coming weeks, and isn't quite
	    implemented correctly when building queries containing more than
	    one term.

	  o Stemming algorithms for dutch, english, french, german, italian,
	    portuguese and spanish added and tested.

	  o Searching through DA databases, raw text files (with naive
	    indexer) and multiple databases implemented.

	  o Documentation in a reasonably sorry state.  Next week is
	    documentation week.
