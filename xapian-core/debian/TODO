Man pages.  All binaries installed should have section 1 man pages.  In
addition, a section 3 man page should be written to describe libxapian. (See
the xml-config and libxml manpages for examples.)

xapian-doc: in index.html, there is one broken link (which occurs in two
places, pointing to the full source documentation, since we don't generate the
full for xapian source documentation).  We could move this to point to the
xapian website.  There should almost certainly be a link back to the front page
of the Xapian website, too.  The documentation should also probably be in the
style of the Xapian website, and should use the Xapian logo on the front page.

Build-Depend on graphviz means that this wouldn't be able to go into the "main"
archive in Debian, because graphviz is non-free.  Possible approaches:
 1) remove build depend, and ensure that "dot" isn't used when generating
    documentation (so that result of packaging is consistent whether dot is
    available or not)
 2) find a free replacement for dot.  (there's one for neato (springgraph),
    so maybe there's one for dot).
 3) write a free replacement for dot.
