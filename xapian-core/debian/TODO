Man pages.  A section 3 man page should be written to describe libxapian. (See
the libxml manpage for example.)

We should also produce a libxapian-dbg package, containing a debug build of
the library.  Not entirely clear which debugging options we should use:
perhaps --enable-debug=full

xapian-doc: in index.html, there is one broken link (which occurs in two
places, pointing to the "internal classes" documentation, since we don't
generate this by default).  We could move this to point to the xapian website.
There should almost certainly be a link back to the front page of the Xapian
website, too.  The documentation should also probably be in the style of the
Xapian website, and should use the Xapian logo on the front page.

Make a xapian-examples package, and put the simple* examples in there, together
with their source code.
