xapian-core (0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove empty maintainer scripts, allowing debhelper to make them.
  * Add rules to make symlinks to config.guess and config.sub, and added
    Build-Depends on autotools-dev.  Remove Build-Depends on automake,
    autoconf and libtool (these will be run before the source package is
    generated).
  * Add some more items to TODO list.
