This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstreami
source.  For information on using quilt see:

/usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source

One slightly unusual feature of the packaging is that the build-dependency
on quilt is only added if there are patches listed in debian/patches/series
(debian/control is generated from the template debian/control.in).
