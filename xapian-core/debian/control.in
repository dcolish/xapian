Description: Search engine library
 This package contains the core Xapian runtime library, and the Xapian query
 parser library.
 .
 The Xapian search engine library is designed to be a highly adaptable toolkit
 to allow developers to easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to
 their own applications.  It implements the probabilistic model of information
 retrieval, and provides facilities for performing ranked free-text searches,
 relevance feedback, phrase searching, boolean searching, stemming, and
 simultaneous update and searching. It is highly scaleable, and is capable of
 working with collections containing many millions of documents.
 .
 The Xapian query parser is a flexible query parser, accepting a syntax
 similar to that of popular web search engines, and converting this to a query
 object suitable for use in the Xapian search engine library.
