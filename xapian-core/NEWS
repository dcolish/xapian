Announcing version 0.3.0 of Muscat.
===================================

This release contains some fairly significant API changes; applications
will require several modifications to work with this version.

Note that the Java, Perl and Python bindings will not function with this
release, due to the incompatible API changes: a release containing updated
versions of these will be made soon.


This release is available from the usual place:
        http://open.muscat.com/download/index.html

	http://open.muscat.com/developer/index.html


API modifications:

 * An OmSettings classes is now used to store settings for various other
   classes.  It stores (name, value) pairs, which avoids library binary
   compatibility problems when new settings are added.

   The parameters available are documented with the OmSettings class,
   see the "omsettings.h" header file, or
   http://open.muscat.com/developer/docs/apidoc/html/class_OmSettings.html

 * OmDataBase, OmWritableDatabase and OmDatabaseGroup now use OmSettings
   rather than vector<string>.  OmMatchOptions and OmExpandOptions have
   also been replaced by OmSettings (as has the internal class
   DatabaseBuilderParams).

   Updating your code should be a very quick job - all the code in
   om-examples was updated in about 10 minutes.  If you have any problems
   updating, let us know and we'll try to help.

 * om_queryop is now replaced by OmQuery::op.  

   For example, code should be changed from
     OmQuery(OM_MOP_OR, "a", "b")
   to
     OmQuery(OmQuery::OP_OR, "a", "b")

 * A transaction must now be begun within an explicit session - implicit
   sessions will only be started for single operations.  As a result,
   begin_transaction() no longer takes a timeout parameter.
   
 * Replaced OmWritableDatabase::end_transaction() by
   OmWritableDatabase::commit_transaction() and
   OmWritableDatabase::cancel_transaction().

   Cancelling will prevent the changes within the transaction
   being applied to the database.

 * const's added in various appropriate places (eg, OmData and OmKey
   constructors).

 * We now always refer to the sleepycat database backend as "sleepycat",
   never as "sleepy".  Only externally visible effect is in options to
   configure.

 * All externally visibile references to "net"/"network" backend now
   call it "remote".


There aren't many new features with this release.  Some of the tasks
performed include:

 * Within query frequency and query size are now used in the weighting
   formula.

 * Work began on the new database type: this is codenamed "quartz".  In
   the absence of any better suggestions, future database types will be
   named after rocks.

 * Much of apitest is now translated into Python, for testing the Python
   bindings.  Most of these tests ran correctly, before Python bindings
   were broken by the new API. ;-)

 * Many internal tidyups.  Lots of items removed from the TODO list.

 * Nearly possible to have user-defined weighting schemes.

 * Incorporated Jon Fielder's patches to TcpServer - it's now a
   forking server rather than serving connections one at a time.

 * Improved documentation comments throughout.

 * Added DA format databases to tests performed by apitest.

 * "Difficulty" column added to TODO list!


Bugs fixed include:

 * Fixed a bug which could cause a TCP server to loop nastily if
   an exception were thrown.

 * Fixed wdf handling in inmemory backend.

 

Announcing version 0.2.1 of Muscat.
===================================

This release contains many bugfixes and new features.  We recommend
upgrading to this version.

It has been two months since the last release: as a result, this release
note is rather lengthy.  We have had 40k of entries in ChangeLog since the
last time I compiled one of these...

Expect the next minor release to happen sooner.


This release is available from the usual place:
        http://open.muscat.com/download/index.html

As ever, for the most up-to-date documentation, see our online copy at
	http://open.muscat.com/developer/index.html


API modifications:

 * API change: changed OmWritableDatabase considerably, so that it
   has begin_session() and end_session() methods instead of lock()
   and unlock() methods, amongst other things.

 * API change: renamed OmExpandOptions::use_query_terms() to
   OmExpandOptions::set_use_query_terms().  This is to be consistent
   with OmMatchOptions' naming scheme.

 * API addition: added NEAR and PHRASE operators to om_queryop, and
   added a window size parameter to the appropriate OmQuery constructors.

 * API addition: added OmExpandOptions::use_exact_termfreq() to
   allow disabling of termfreq approximation in ExpandWeight.

 * API addition: Add an OmEnquire::get_query() method, to retrieve the
   query which was set.

 * API addition: Add get_description() methods to all API objects,
   returning a human readable description of the contents of the object.

 * API addition: Added output operators for API objects, so that you can
   do, for example, "cout << omenquire;"

 * API addition: added OmInvalidOperationError to report invalid
   API usage, for example, ending a session when one hasn't been
   begun.

 * API addition: added OmDatabaseCorruptError to report that a
   database has become corrupt.

 * API addition: added OmDatabaseLockError to report when a lock on
   a database couldn't be aquired.

 * API addition: added get_type() method to OmError, to return a string
   describing the class.

 * API addition: added OmMSet::get_termfreq() and OmMSet::get_termweight()
   methods, to get information about the terms involved in the query.

Here are the highlights of the new features:

 * Added phrase and near-term searching.

 * New stemming algorithms - for Norwegian, Swedish and Danish.

 * Better autodetection of available features.  Muscat should now compile
   on Solaris "out-of-the-box", with either GCC or the native compiler.

 * All tests now pass, for all database types (including the network database
   type, used for distributed searching).

 * Added threadtest, for testing of Muscat in multithreaded use.

 * Debugging system has been thouroughly reworked: much easier to get
   details of what's going on, and control the level of debug information
   by the OM_DEBUG_FILE and OM_DEBUG_TYPES environment variables. Also
   memory allocation trapping has been improved in the testsuite, with
   the OM_NEW_TRAP[_COUNT] environment variables.

 * Java API is now up-to-date with the C++ API, except for the database
   writing methods.  The Java API is also tested with an automatically
   translated subset of apitest, and passes all 32 of these tests.

 * Omega, an example CGI based search system (derived from the old
   ferretfx example) has been added to the examples.

 * Delve, a simple utility to inspect databases, has been added to the
   tests.  This will currently only compile with GCC.

 * Various new tests added to testsuite.

 See the Changelog for full details of the work done (but beware - it's
 40k of stuff since the last release).

Bugs fixed include:

 * Pretty much any concurrent access to Muscat was causing occasional memory
   corruption / segfaults / other weird behaviour.  After a huge bughunt,
   we finally traced this to the standard C++ library we were using,
   libstdc++.  Recompiling using the STLport C++ library, fixes the
   problem, so we have added configuration options to support this (see the
   INSTALL file for details).

 * Concurrency problems in Muscat 3.6 databases fixed.  It's now safe for
   multiple threads to perform searches across the same OmDatabaseGroup
   object (using separate OmEnquire objects).

 * Fix potential concurrency problem in big file descriptor stuff:
   although it was very unlikely to have actually caused a problem.

 * Distributed searching didn't work with DA or DB databases, due to
   unimplemented do_get_all_keys() methods.


The next tasks ahead of us are:

 * Continue the developement of the Java, Perl and Python interfaces to
   Muscat, to get the Perl and Python versions up-to-date, and to keep
   them all in sync with the full API.

   Chris Emerson is working on this.

 * A new general purpose database backend.  The existing Sleepycat backend
   is functionally complete, but is highly inefficient: try indexing more
   than a few 1000 documents, and the system will slow to a crawl.  This
   is due to an inefficient design, so a new system is being written using
   the knowledge gained, a newer version of Berkeley DB.

   The existing "Sleepycat" database backend will provide a useful cross-check
   for correctness during the development of the new backend, and will then be
   removed.

   I am performing this work.

 * Creation of an indexing system, for taking documents and parsing them into
   terms, keys and data.  We are working on a detailed design for this, which
   will be added to the documentation reasonably soon.

   Chris Emerson will be working on this.

 * As ever, completing the items in the TODO list...

Have fun with this release, and as ever let us know of any problems /
successes you have.



Announcing version 0.2.0 of Muscat.
===================================

This release contains many bugfixes and new features.  We recommend
upgrading to this version.


This release is available from the usual place:
        http://open.muscat.com/download/index.html

As ever, for the most up-to-date documentation, see our online copy at
	http://open.muscat.com/developer/index.html


API changes:

 * A new OmMatchOption has been added, to allow the user to set a large
   query, of which only the most important, elite, terms should be used
   when actually performing the query.

 * A new exception may be thrown by some methods, when performing
   distributed searching: OmNetworkTimeoutError.

 * Format of sleepycat databases has (incompatibly) changed.  Expect this
   to keep occurring for the next month or two...


And here are the highlights of the new features:

 * Distributed searching is now implemented.  Work remains to be done on:

   i)   Improving efficiency (in particular, the server is single threaded)
   ii)  Adding ability to use MatchDeciders on remote databases.
   iii) Improving configurability (especially timeout times).

   In all other aspects, this feature is now complete.  It is all pretty
   transparent from the users point of view: simply run a set of servers,
   and open network databases giving their addresses, but has required a
   lot of work, and a lot of internal reorganisation.

   (Well done Chris, for getting this going!)

 * InMemory databases now don't have indexing hacked into them: they are
   plain honest writable databases.

 * Many more tests have been added to the test suite.

   Also, the test suite now runs all suitable tests on databases of each
   type, in turn.  Currently tests inmemory and sleepycat databases, and
   optionally network databases (which fail one test due to unimplemented
   functionality).  All other tests pass.

 * Initial work on producing scripting language interfaces (using SWIG).
   We currently have interfaces to the stemming algorithms from Perl and
   Python, and as I type Chris is working on extending this to our entire
   API.

 * Many other things I can't remember: see the ChangeLog...


Bugs fixed include:

 * The OmMSet::mbound member will have the maximum value from each of the
   sub-databases, rather than the value from the first database (which
   could be far too small).

 * An exception will be thrown if a term of zero length is supplied to the
   library, rather than mysterious strange behaviour occuring.

 * Sleepycat has been virtually rewritten in order to make it work
   correctly.

 * Collapse now works correctly across multiple databases.

 * More memory / resource leaks fixed.



Announcing version 0.1.3 of Muscat.
===================================

This is mainly a bugfix release: we suggest upgrading to this version.


This release is available from the usual place:
        http://open.muscat.com/download/index.html

As ever, for the most up-to-date documentation, see our online copy at
	http://open.muscat.com/developer/index.html


The bugs fixed are:

 * MultiMatch was failing to return the correct document ID's: this was
   causing searches across multiple databases to return effectively useless
   results.

 * Memory leaks in DA / DB databases.

 * Memory leaks in OmQuery constructor.

 * Miscellaneous other memory leaks.


There's been a minor API change, concerning the database writing API.

 * OmDocumentContents now contains OmData and a set of OmKey objects, rather
   than strings.  Added constructors to OmData and OmKey.


There have been several other changes:

 * More work on the distributed searching.

 * Termlists are now implemented for the sleepycat stuff - expand now works.

 * PostingLists can now return a PositionList, containing the locations at
   which a posting occurs within a document.  This is implemented for
   sleepycat.

 * Parameter checks when opening databases now throw
   OmInvalidArgumentError exceptions, rather than just being Asserts.

 * Test suite now attempts to detect memory leaks.

 * More tests in the test suite, and fixes to code.

 * Test suite now passes all tests.



Announcing version 0.1.2 of Muscat.
===================================

It's been a month since the last release, and a lot has happened since
then.  We've been to a conference (the BCS IRSG), got a prototype
of distributed searching working, written a writable database,
and improved the documentation a great deal.

In particular, we've now got a "QuickStart" guide, leading you through
some simple examples of how to use Muscat.


This release is available from the usual place:
        http://open.muscat.com/download/index.html

As ever, for the most up-to-date documentation, see our online copy at
	http://open.muscat.com/developer/index.html


There have been a couple of API changes, the first one of which is
backwards INCOMPATIBLE.

 * OmDatabase has been renamed to OmDatabaseGroup.  After all, that's what
   it actually is...

 * New classes/structs (OmWritableDatabase, OmDocumentContents and
   OmDocumentTerm) have been added to the API, for writing to databases.
   Note that this part of the API should be considered experimental: we'll
   no doubt be changing it somewhat in the coming weeks.


There have been lots of other changes:

 * Created an API for writing to databases (centered around the
   new OmWritableDatabase class).

 * Implemented sleepycat backend, enough to perform queries.  There are
   still significant amounts of work to do on this, (regarding collection
   statistics, termlists, and keys), but the fundamental operations
   needed to support retrieval are there.  This is the first writable
   database!

 * Greatly improved documentation: especially see the quickstart guide, at
   docs/quickstart.html in the om package, or online at
   http://open.muscat.com/developer/docs/quickstart.html

 * Added many documentation comments throughout the code, and started using
   Doxygen to generate documentation instead of doc++.

 * Reworked the weighting schemes to allow easier plugging in of new schemes.
   Made the pure boolean queries simply use a different weighting scheme,
   fixing the reversebool test failures and removing significant amounts of
   duplicated code.

 * Many internal changes to allow distributed searching, and to clean up
   the code.  Further implementation of distributed searching: we now have
   a functioning prototype.

 * Fixes to the Autoconf macro for finding the Muscat library.

 * Various bug fixes, including one for a bug causing a segfault when
   searching for terms not present in the database.

 * Test suite now passes all tests.
