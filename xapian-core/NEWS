Announcing the version 0.2.0 of Muscat.
=======================================

This release contains many bugfixes and new features.  We recommend
upgrading to this version.

API changes:

 * A new OmMatchOption has been added, to allow the user to set a large
   query, of which only the most important, elite, terms should be used
   when actually performing the query.

 * A new exception may be thrown by some methods, when performing
   distributed searching: OmNetworkTimeoutError.

 * Format of sleepycat databases has (incompatibly) changed.  Expect this
   to keep occurring for the next month or two...


And here are the highlights of the new features:

 * Distributed searching is now implemented.  Work remains to be done on:

   i)   Improving efficiency (in particular, the server is single threaded)
   ii)  Adding ability to use MatchDeciders on remote databases.
   iii) Improving configurability (especially timeout times).

   In all other aspects, this feature is now complete.  It is all pretty
   transparent from the users point of view: simply run a set of servers,
   and open network databases giving their addresses, but has required a
   lot of work, and a lot of internal reorganisation.

   (Well done Chris, for getting this going!)

 * InMemory databases now don't have indexing hacked into them: they are
   plain honest writable databases.

 * Many more tests have been added to the test suite.

   Also, the test suite now runs all suitable tests on databases of each
   type, in turn.  Currently tests inmemory and sleepycat databases, and
   optionally network databases (which fail one test due to unimplemented
   functionality).  All other tests pass.

 * Initial work on producing scripting language interfaces (using SWIG).
   We currently have interfaces to the stemming algorithms from Perl and
   Python, and as I type Chris is working on extending this to our entire
   API.

 * Many other things I can't remember: see the ChangeLog...


Bugs fixed include:

 * The OmMSet::mbound member will have the maximum value from each of the
   sub-databases, rather than the value from the first database (which
   could be far too small).

 * An exception will be thrown if a term of zero length is supplied to the
   library, rather than mysterious strange behaviour occuring.

 * Sleepycat has been virtually rewritten in order to make it work
   correctly.

 * Collapse now works correctly across multiple databases.

 * More memory / resource leaks fixed.



Announcing the version 0.1.3 of Muscat.
=======================================

This is mainly a bugfix release: we suggest upgrading to this version.


This release is available from the usual place:
        http://open.muscat.com/download/index.html

	http://open.muscat.com/developer/index.html


The bugs fixed are:

 * MultiMatch was failing to return the correct document ID's: this was
   causing searches across multiple databases to return effectively useless
   results.

 * Memory leaks in DA / DB databases.

 * Memory leaks in OmQuery constructor.

 * Miscellaneous other memory leaks.


There's been a minor API change, concerning the database writing API.

 * OmDocumentContents now contains OmData and a set of OmKey objects, rather
   than strings.  Added constructors to OmData and OmKey.


There have been several other changes:

 * More work on the distributed searching.

 * Termlists are now implemented for the sleepycat stuff - expand now works.

 * PostingLists can now return a PositionList, containing the locations at
   which a posting occurs within a document.  This is implemented for
   sleepycat.

 * Parameter checks when opening databases now throw
   OmInvalidArgumentError exceptions, rather than just being Asserts.

 * Test suite now attempts to detect memory leaks.

 * More tests in the test suite, and fixes to code.

 * Test suite now passes all tests.



Announcing the version 0.1.2 of Muscat.
=======================================

It's been a month since the last release, and a lot has happened since
then.  We've been to a conference (the BCS IRSG), got a prototype
of distributed searching working, written a writable database,
and improved the documentation a great deal.

In particular, we've now got a "QuickStart" guide, leading you through
some simple examples of how to use Muscat.

There have been a couple of API changes, the first one of which is
backwards INCOMPATIBLE.

 * OmDatabase has been renamed to OmDatabaseGroup.  After all, that's what
   it actually is...

 * New classes/structs (OmWritableDatabase, OmDocumentContents and
   OmDocumentTerm) have been added to the API, for writing to databases.
   Note that this part of the API should be considered experimental: we'll
   no doubt be changing it somewhat in the coming weeks.


There have been lots of other changes:

 * Created an API for writing to databases (centered around the
   new OmWritableDatabase class).

 * Implemented sleepycat backend, enough to perform queries.  There are
   still significant amounts of work to do on this, (regarding collection
   statistics, termlists, and keys), but the fundamental operations
   needed to support retrieval are there.  This is the first writable
   database!

 * Greatly improved documentation: especially see the quickstart guide, at
   docs/quickstart.html in the om package, or online at
   http://open.muscat.com/developer/docs/quickstart.html

 * Added many documentation comments throughout the code, and started using
   Doxygen to generate documentation instead of doc++.

 * Reworked the weighting schemes to allow easier plugging in of new schemes.
   Made the pure boolean queries simply use a different weighting scheme,
   fixing the reversebool test failures and removing significant amounts of
   duplicated code.

 * Many internal changes to allow distributed searching, and to clean up
   the code.  Further implementation of distributed searching: we now have
   a functioning prototype.

 * Fixes to the Autoconf macro for finding the Muscat library.

 * Various bug fixes, including one for a bug causing a segfault when
   searching for terms not present in the database.

 * Test suite now passes all tests.
