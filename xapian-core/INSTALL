Welcome to Muscat
=================

Muscat uses a standard automake / autoconf / libtool / etc setup.
This means that all you need to do to compile a standard distribution
should be:

 1) Run ./configure, possibly with some extra arguments (see below)
 2) Run make

[ Don't do this step yet, since we havn't yet specified what should get
installed...
 3) Run make install to install Muscat
]

Options to give to configure:
=============================

Note: If you wish to perform your build in a separate directory from the
source, change to the build directory, and run the configure script
(in the source directory) from the build directory.

ie: mkdir BUILD; cd BUILD; ../configure

--enable-debug
	You should use this to build a version of muscat with debugging
	symbols and assertions to help with debugging.  Recommended for
	initial development with muscat - this helps to ensure that you
	are using the API correctly.
	(Note: This is currently the default option, due to the early
	stage of development of this project.)

--enable-backend-*
	These options enable the compiling of each of the backends.  (Database
	access methods.)  Use "./configure --help" to get a full list of
	the backends.  By default, all backends for which the appropriate
	libraries are available will be enabled.

Developers:
===========

There are additional scripts and configure options to help developers and
people who are building from CVS.  Read HACKING to find out about them.
