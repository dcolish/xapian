Muscat uses a standard automake / autoconf / libtool / etc setup.
This means that all you need to do to compile a standard distribution
should be:

 1) Run ./configure, possibly with some extra arguments (see below)
 2) Run make
 3) Run make install to install Muscat

Options to give to configure:
=============================

Note: If you wish to perform your build in a separate directory from the
source, change to the build directory, and run the configure script
(in the source directory) from the build directory.

ie: mkdir BUILD; cd BUILD; ../configure

--enable-debug
	Should use this to build a version of muscat with debugging symbols
	and assertions to help with debugging.  Recommended for initial
	development with muscat - this helps to ensure that you are using
	the API correctly.

--enable-debug=paranoid
--enable-debug=full
	Should use one of these if you're going to be developing muscat.
	"full" gives 

Building from CVS:
==================

The CVS repository does not contain any automatically generated files
(such as configure and Makefile.in's).  Because of this, you need to run
several programs to build these files, before you can run the normal
build process.

At the time of writing, these programs are autoconf, libtool and automake.

We have provided a simple standard script (based on one used by the
Gnome Project - http://www.gnome.org/) to run these programs for you:
simply run ./autogen.sh, in the same way you would normally run configure.
Any arguments passed to autogen.sh are in turn passed on to configure.

You may need to add extra macro directories to the path searched by aclocal
(which is part of autoconf) - you may do this by specifying these in the
ACLOCAL_FLAGS environment variable.
