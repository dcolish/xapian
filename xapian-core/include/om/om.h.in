#ifdef __GNUC__
// When building the library with GCC, generate preprocessor code to check that
// any version of GCC used to build applications has a matching C++ ABI. This
// means that users get a nice explanatory error message rather than a
// confusing link failure (or worse a program which builds but crashes).
// Another benefit is that the check happens near the start of compilation of
// the first source file which uses Xapian in the user's application, rather
// than during the first attempt to link with Xapian.
//
// After preprocessing with "g++ -E" or similar (which will expand macros,
// strip comments such as this block, etc) we remove blank lines and collapse
// multiple spaces.
// 
// In this file, use "% " at the start of a line when you want a "//" comment,
// % on a line by itself // for a blank line, % at the start of a line with
// no space after it for a "#", and % elsewhere // for a __ (so e.g. when we
// want __GXX_ABI_VERSION literally, we write %GXX_ABI_VERSION).
