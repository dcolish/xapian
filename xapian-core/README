Welcome to Xapian!
==================

Xapian is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License.  You
should find a copy of the GNU General Public License in the file "COPYING"
in the top level of this distribution of Xapian.

See the file "INSTALL" for information on building and installing Xapian.
If you're wanting to modify Xapian itself or build sources from SVN, the
contents of the file "HACKING" are recommended reading.

Xapian is partly derived from software originally developed by BrightStation
plc under the GPL as a replacement for their proprietary Muscat 3.6 Information
Retrieval library (which was written almost entirely in BCPL, and becoming hard
to extend in the ways they wanted).  The project was originally known as
OpenMuscat and then was renamed Omsee.  Shortly after renaming it, they sadly
decided to take development closed-source.

A number of developers (including some former BrightStation employees) took the
last GPLed version and have been continuing development under the GPL.  This
project was initially known as OmSeek, but BrightStation complained this was
too close to their (untrademarked and unpublicised) name Omsee.  It was simpler
to change it than to argue, and the name Xapian was chosen.

The last numbered BrightStation release was OpenMuscat 0.4.1, although there
was extensive development in CVS after that.  The first official Xapian release
was 0.5.0.
