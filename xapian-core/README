Welcome to Xapian.

See the file "INSTALL" for information on building and installing Xapian.

Xapian is based on software originally developed by BrightStation plc under the
GPL as a replacement for their closed source Muscat 3.6 Information Retrieval
library (which was written almost entirely in BCPL, and becoming hard to extend
in the ways they wanted).  The project was originally known as OpenMuscat and
later Omsee.  They sadly decided to take Omsee development closed-source.

A number of developers (including some former BrightStation employees) took the
last GPLed version and have been continuing development under the GPL.  This
project was initially known as OmSeek, but BrightStation complained this was
too close to their (untrademarked and unpublicised) name Omsee.  It was simpler
to change it than to argue, and the name Xapian was chosen.

The last numbered BrightStation release was Omsee 0.4.1, although there was
extensive development in CVS after that.  The first official Xapian release is
0.5.0.

The Xapian website is <http://www.xapian.org/>; you can find downloads, mailing
lists, CVS access, and other useful resources there.
