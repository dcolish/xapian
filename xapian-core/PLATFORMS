This is a list of platforms which Xapian has been tested on, and which people
have reported back to us about.  It will probably work on many more platforms
- lack of an entry here shouldn't be assumed to mean it won't work, just that
nobody has reported to us that it works.

Solaris                   | 0.2.0          | Tests pass if compiled as a
                          |                | static library - problems due
