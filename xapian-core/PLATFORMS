This is a list of platforms which Xapian has been tested on, and which people
have reported back to us about.  It will probably work on many more platforms
- lack of an entry here shouldn't be assumed to mean it won't work, just that
we've not tested it ourselves and nobody has reported to us that it works.

A general note about GCC 2.95 - on many platforms, certain tests (deldoc1
notably) may fail with OMEXCEPT - investigation reveals that the correct
exception is being thrown, but is leaking through the catch block somehow.
Adding tracing code often make the problem go away.  We believe this is a
code generation problem or similar - it's never been seen with GCC 3.0 or
newer.  The table below ignores such test failures.

[1] ./configure spits many warnings but apparently succeeds.

[2] GNU make must be used to run the tests (gmake check, not make check).
    Building the library can be done using the native Solaris make.

[3] Must be compiled as a static library (--disable-shared).
