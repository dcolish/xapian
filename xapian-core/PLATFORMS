This is a list of platforms which Xapian has been reported to have built
and passed "make check" on.  It will probably work on many more platforms
- lack of an entry here shouldn't be assumed to mean it won't work, just that
we've not had any reports.

If you try a platform not listed here (or try a newer version on a listed
platform) we'd love to hear - please at least include the OS version (e.g.
output from "uname -a"), compiler and version (e.g. output from g++ -v), and
any switches you passed to configure.

Two notes about GCC 2.95:

* GCC 2.95 reports a lot of warnings about control reaching the end of
  non-void functions - these are bogus, and can be safely ignored.

* On many platforms, certain tests (deldoc1 notably) used to fail with
  Xapian::Error exceptions - investigation revealed that the correct exception
  was being thrown, but was leaking through the catch block somehow.  Adding
  tracing code often made the test pass!  We believe this is a GCC 2.95 bug -
  it's never been reported with GCC 3.0 or higher.  The testsuite framework
  should now detect such mishandled exceptions, and skip the test in progress
  with an appropriate message.

Older success reports lacking an update for a more recent Xapian version
(typically because the machine in question was upgraded, or we no longer
have access to it, or the report was from a third party):

~ = Tested version from CVS shortly before this release (or after for ~ suffix)

[1] ./configure emits many warnings (we believe these are harmless):
mv: [FILE]: set owner/group (was: [USERNO]/[GROUPNO]): Operation not permitted

[2] Must be compiled as a static library (--disable-shared).

[3] "make check" won't work for a cross-compiled build, but once copied to a
Windows box some tests fail; Remote backend is automatically disabled (the
remote backend needs fork() and socketpair(), neither of which mingw provides).
Tests which pass are: internaltest, stemtest, queryparsertest.  apitest on
quartz backend and quartztest fail with "out of memory"; btreetest passes
simple1, but fails the other 3 test cases.

[4] "make check" won't work for a cross-compiled build.  Not tried to run the
binaries yet; Remote backend is automatically disabled (the remote backend
needs fork() and socketpair(), neither of which djgpp provides - it has a
stub for fork(), but it will always fail).

[5] Need to add '#include <stdio.h>' to bin/quartzcompact.cc.

[6] internaltest fails on exception1 (SEGV) and apitest fails on queryvalid1
(SEGV).  Other tests pass.

[7] libxapian fails to link with multiply defined symbol errors - it looks like
libtool is getting it wrong.
