This is a list of platforms which Xapian has been tested on, and which people
have reported back to us about.  It will probably work on many more platforms
- lack of an entry here shouldn't be assumed to mean it won't work.

Platform                  | Xapian Version | Result

Linux - Redhat 6.01       | v0.2.0         | All tests pass
Linux - Debian (Potato)   | v0.2.0         | All tests pass
Solaris                   | v0.2.0         | Tests pass if compiled as a
                          |                | static library - problems due
			  |                | to exceptions if compiled as
