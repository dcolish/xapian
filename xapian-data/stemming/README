This directory heirarchy contains test data for the Muscat stemming
algorithms.  The heirarchy is organised into a set of directories,
one for each stemming algorithm.  The actual stemming data is stored in
a subdirectory ('data') in each of these directories, as a pair of files:

  voc.txt  -- A list of words, one per line.
  voc.st   -- The result of passing these words through the stemming
              algorithm.
