This directory contains test data for the Snowball stemming algorithms
which Xapian uses.  In most cases this test data is taken direct from
Snowball, but sometimes we add extra data, or if Snowball has no data
for a language we include some from another source.

There are 2 files for each language:

 <language>/voc.txt    -- A list of words, one per line.
 <language>/output.txt -- The result of stemming each word.
