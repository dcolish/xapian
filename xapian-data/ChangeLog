	* stemming/: Use new snowball vocab lists and stemmed word lists -
	  changes character set to UTF-8, and updates some of the stemmings
	  to reflect changes in the snowball stemmers.

	* stemming/: Use Snowball vocab lists instead of the old Xapian ones;
	  removed stopword lists (we'll use the Snowball ones, but they want
	  to be in xapian-core which everyone downloads, not with the stemmer
	  test data which few people need).

	* stemming/: Fixed layout of stopsource files where the muscat3.6
	  style "e^a" accents have been changed into "é" etc.

	* stemming/: Updated files so that they are correct for the Snowball
	  stemmers (which use iso-8859-1 accents and produce slightly
	  different results).
