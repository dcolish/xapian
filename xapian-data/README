This module contains data useful when developing
OMSeek, but unnecessary for developing /with/ it (eg:
test data).

Due to a stupid mistake on my part, the whole OMSeek
source tree was dumped in here by mistake; there's
one inconveniently named file which I can't get rid of.
Ignore the om/ and om-examples/ modules if they appear.
