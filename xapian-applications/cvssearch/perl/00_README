say you want to build a file: myfile.cgi in src/perl

1. remove the first line of myfile.cgi (the line containing
#!/usr/local/bin/perl) and rename the new file as myfile-script.pl (or
myfile.pl or whatever you wish to call it, but I will assume you will use
myfile-script.pl below)

2. cvs add myfile-script.pl into the repository.

3. modify perl/Makefile.am:
3.1. add to the entry bin_SCRIPTS myfile.cgi       This makes sure
myfile.cgi is copied to the cgi-bin.
3.2. add to the entry EXTRA_DIST  myfile-script.pl This makes sure
myfile-script.pl is included in the tarball when you try to build the
package with the command "make dist"

3.3. add to the end of perl/Makefile.am the following two lines:

myfile.cgi: $(srcdir)/myfile-script.pl
<TAB>$(PERL) -I $(srcdir) -c $(srcdir)/myfile-script.pl
<TAB>echo "#!$(PERL) -w" | cat $(srcdir)/myfile-script.pl > tmp-$@
<TAB>chmod ugo+rx tmp-$@
<TAB>mv -f tmp-$@ $@

make sure to include $(srcdir) as above, otherwise make distcheck will
fail.

4. to create myfile.cgi, type make, the new Makefile will be remade, and
then if any perl scripts contain syntax errors, it will report that.

5. type make install to copy .cgi files into the cgi-bin directory.
