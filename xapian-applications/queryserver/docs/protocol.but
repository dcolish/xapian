\A{protocol} Communications protocol

The communications protocol is intentionally kept extremely simple.  A
conversation consists of exactly two messages, and is always initiated by the
client.

Much of the data passed over the protocol is Base64 encoded - this avoids
problems with communications channels dealing badly with certain character
codes.
