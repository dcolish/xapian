QueryServer is the work of:
Richard Boulton

It was initially developed for Studio 24 (http://studio24.net/)

It uses Base64 encoding and decoding algorithms copied from PuTTY
(http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), written by Simon Tatham.
These have subsequently been modified by Richard Boulton, so any bugs are
probably his fault.
