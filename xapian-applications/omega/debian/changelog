xapian-omega (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Now builds with GCC 4.3 snapshot.  Closes: #417767
  * debian/control.in: Update "Suggests:" for changes in omindex: change
    pstotext to gs-common since omindex now indexes PostScript by converting
    it to PDF first since that appears to be the only way to handle PostScript
    containing non-latin1 characters; add libwps-tools for MS Works documents.
  * debian/copyright: Update.
  * debian/rules: We don't need to pass --mandir or --infodir to configure
    as the values we explicitly set are the defaults anyway (and we don't
    have any documentation in "info" format).
  * debian/patch: Include patch from Xapian SVN to fix a small (and
    long-standing - this dates back to at least Omega 0.8.2) issue in the HTML
    parser to do with handling tags with only whitespace between them.
  * debian/rules: Install the new "templates/inc" subdirectory and its
    contents.
  * debian/xapian-omega.install: The documentation is now installed in the
    directory we want it in by default - we no longer need to move it.  Also
    the path where the omega CGI binary is installed by default has changed.

    after we've officially released them).
