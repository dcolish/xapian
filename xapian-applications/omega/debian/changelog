xapian-omega (0.8.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge xapian-omega and xapian-scriptindex packages, to reduce complexity
    of maintainance, and also because there is a slight possibility of them
    being merged in future.  (It is tidier not to have to merge packages
    after we've officially released them).
