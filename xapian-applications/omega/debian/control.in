Description: CGI search interface and indexers using Xapian
 This package contains the "omega" CGI application which provides a
 customisable web interface for searching Xapian databases.
 .
 The package also contains the "omindex" tool for indexing local documents
 into a Xapian database in a form suitable for searching with omega.
 .
 This package also contains the "scriptindex" indexer, which takes a simple
 text input format representing documents as a set of fields, together
 with an "index script" file specifying actions to be performed on each field,
 and processes the documents into a Xapian database.
 .
 The package also contains some example scripts for converting data from
 different sources into a form suitable for processing with "scriptindex".
