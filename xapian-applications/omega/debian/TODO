Package descriptions could do with some improvement.

Make a default configuration file for omega, and place it in the appropriate
location.

Remove code which causes omega to look for a configuration file in its runtime
directory.  Possibly add code so that the configfile location (or contents) can
be overridden by environment variables (with apache, these can be set using
mod_env, and with apache 1.3.7 or later this may be used inside a .htaccess
file).

Make a debconf question for omega package, asking if user wants to set up a
database holding the system documentation, and how frequently this should be
reindexed.

Split dbi2omega into a separate package, which actually Depends on libdbi-perl?
I don't feel comfortable about part of the xapian-scriptindex package not
working at all if the Recommends dependency isn't satisfied, but dbi2omega is
such a trivial thing I'm not happy about making a package just for it.
Perhaps it should simply be installed as an example, under /usr/share/doc/

Include htdig2omega stuff into packages.
