Thu Nov 29 16:53:45 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* NEAR phrases (e.g. "a NEAR b NEAR c") now work; removed "{a b c}" syntax for
	  NEAR phrases.

Thu Nov 29 15:25:54 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $highlight{} now allows you to specify the tags to use for the
	  highlighting.

Thu Nov 29 15:24:53 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* topdoc is unsigned so subtracting and then checking if it's < 0 doesn't
	  work...

Wed Nov 28 15:45:39 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed clipping of hit page in case when there are a multiple of HITSPERPAGE
	  matches. 

Wed Nov 28 14:03:48 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added $hostname{URL}; $version output now says "Xapian - omega <version>".

Wed Nov 28 13:04:46 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* docs/cgiparams.txt: Minor corrections and updates.

Wed Nov 28 13:03:40 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* If we're asked for a page of hits beyond the end of the matches, clip to the
	  last page of matches rather than the first.

Wed Nov 28 13:02:31 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* For an EXTENDED_QUERY, force the first page of hits.

Wed Nov 28 12:56:56 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Lower case terms when constructing the query (otherwise why
	  do we store them in the database that way? :-)

Wed Nov 28 12:36:49 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fettled default query template.

Wed Nov 28 12:33:52 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Request one more match than the last we want to display so we can tell if the
	  next page of hits is empty or not - otherwise we risk offering a "next page"
	  link when there are no more hits.

Mon Nov 26 16:28:00 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* --no-recurse / -l option added; useful if your sites are
	  nested in their disc storage (particularly things like
	  http://example.com/ being a distinct site, with
	  http://example.com/product being within it)

	* --mime-type now really works (it was --mime-map in the code)

	* documentation updated further

Mon Nov 26 14:39:00 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* options parsing fixed so minimised/unrecognised long options
	  doesn't segfault

Mon Nov 26 14:00:13 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* omindex can now index part of a site (previously 'subsite')
	  by having an index base within the site's disc storage

Mon Nov 26 13:57:10 2001  James Aylett <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Documentation updated for recent changes

Thu Nov 22 13:24:45 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Use $nice{} in query template, but don't use $freqs.  Use numbers as
	  page image button tooltips on Netscape 4.

Thu Nov 22 13:02:17 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Herded escaped CGI parameter mangling code back into cgiparam.cc;
	  added special handling for  numeric image button names.

Thu Nov 22 12:55:00 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed $nice to put the comma (or dot) in the right place.

Tue Nov 20 17:30:19 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $lastpage now returns 0 when there are no matches (previously
	  gave a very large answer).

Tue Nov 20 12:30:47 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $terms now only returns terms which were in the parsed query
	  (boolean filter terms are excluded).

Tue Nov 20 12:07:54 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed bug in date range filtering (got it wrong when start and end
	  date were in the same month).

	* DAYSMINUS now counts back from DATE1 (if specified) rather than
	  always counting back from the present.

Mon Nov 19 17:13:24 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added date-range filtering (not fully tested yet).

Mon Nov 19 15:21:31 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed (c) message displayed by -v (BrightStation "PLC" not "Inc.",
	  first (c) 1999).

Fri Nov 16 11:49:20 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* New OmegaScript commands: $allterms{<docid>}, $freq{<term>},
	  $nice{<number>}, $set_relevant{<docid>}.

	* $map{} now returns a list (shouldn't affect most users - if
	  the extra tabs are a problem, change `$map{...}' to
	  `$list{$map{...},}' ).

	* Template `query' now preserves value of THRESHOLD.

	* Template `godmode' fixed to actually work.

Wed Nov 14 15:04:13 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed to compile with GCC3.0

Wed Nov 14 14:54:53 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated for changes to OmQuery

Tue Nov 06 13:10:15 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated .cvsignore.

Tue Nov 06 13:02:04 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed lookup of CGI parameter THRESHOLD.

Tue Nov  6 12:38:37 GMT 2001  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* Moved configure.ac to configure.in: depending on autoconf 2.13 is
	  not needed yet.

Tue Nov 06 12:23:55 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added support for percentage threshold cutoff (CGI var THRESHOLD);
	  Code for calculating better percentages has been pushed into Xapian
	  so removed it from here.

Mon Nov  5 12:42:26 GMT 2001  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* Omega moved to new home, from om-examples/omega.
	  Standalone build system added.
