Tue Jun 03 11:15:28 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* templates/query: Create log entry in query.log.

Thu May 29 18:03:54 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Fixed bug in DEFAULT_LOG_ENTRY's Omegascript.

Thu May 29 00:22:28 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Set STEM_LANGUAGE near the start of the file so it's easy
	  for users to change until we get better configurability.

Thu May 29 00:00:28 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am,date.cc,date.h,query.cc: Split code to build a
	  date range filter into a separate file.

Wed May 28 23:38:02 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configfile.cc,configfile.h,omega.cc,omega.conf,query.cc,query.h,
	  docs/omegascript.txt,docs/overview.txt,docs/quickstart.txt:
	  Replaced half-hearted logging support with flexible
	  OmegaScript-based approach with new $log command.  Also added
	  $now to allow the current date/time to be logged.

Tue May 27 17:55:24 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Added missing "#include <assert.h>".

Mon May 26 22:41:26 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Don't use libtool; Use AC_CONFIG_FILES - it's the new
	  autoconf way!
			  
Mon May 26 12:12:22 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.spec.in: Removed %changelog - it hasn't been reliably updated
	  and only really makes sense when the packaging is done by a third
	  party anyway.

Mon May 26 12:01:55 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: If the query is empty, don't bother running it through
	  enquire.

Wed Apr 30 01:18:47 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* docs/cgiparams.txt,docs/omegascript.txt: Minor improvements.

Wed Apr 30 01:14:46 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Use correct types for docid and value_no in $value.

Wed Apr 23 16:15:07 BST 2003  Sam Liddicott <sam@liddicott.com>

	* templates/xml: add collapse info to xml template.

Wed Apr 23 14:00:37 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.spec.in: Merged changes from Fabrice Colin.

Thu Apr 10 03:14:51 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Updated for 0.6.5 release.

Wed Apr 09 13:56:14 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.cc,query.cc,omega.h,docs/cgiparams.txt: Renamed DATE1, DATE2,
	  and DAYSMINUS to the more meaningful START, END, and SPAN (NB SPAN
	  is days before END, or after START, or before today - whereas
	  SPAN was before *DATE1* or before today).  The old parameters names
	  are supported (with the original semantics) for now.

Wed Apr 09 13:44:28 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am: Install docs in /usr/share/doc/omega to be FHS
	  compliant.
	* omega.spec.in: Consistently use %{contentdir} instead of /var/lib;
	  removed redundant second setting of %docdir.

Wed Apr 09 01:21:57 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am: Removed bogus extra "\".

Mon Mar 31 19:42:24 BST 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am: Install documentation!
	* omega.spec.in: Merged in changes to RPM packaging from Fabrice Colin
	  and reworked further.

Fri Mar 28 17:47:45 GMT 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* templates/query,templates/query2: Removed bogus setting of defunct
	  xB parameter; correctly propagate multiple B parameters.

Fri Mar 28 17:45:41 GMT 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex.cc: Report correct version number (was hard-wired to 1.0!)

Tue Mar 25 14:46:10 GMT 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: If xP and P are both empty, classify as SAME_QUERY not
	  NEW_QUERY as there may be a boolean query too.
	* query.cc: Fixed off-by-one error in rounding down topdoc - it was
	  possible to get to an empty page of hits if there were exactly a
	  multiple of HITSPERPAGE matches and the matcher over-estimated the
	  number of matches and Omega displayed page links.

Mon Mar 24 09:40:04 GMT 2003  Sam Liddicott <sam.liddicott@orange.co.uk>

	* templates/query: Added propagation of B boolean filter
	* templates/query2: factored about a bit more, query2 is
	  a more modular version of query which will ultimately
	  lend itself to customisation a bit more to the uninitiated.

Tue Mar 04 01:02:12 GMT 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.cc: Fixed handling of multiple DB parameters to be as
	  documented.

Fri Feb 28 09:52:03 GMT 2003 Sam Liddicott <sam.liddicott@orange.co.uk>

	* Added $collapsed to omegascript to give the number of hits
	  collapsed into the current hit, eg:

	  $if{$ne{$collapsed,0},$collapsed hidden results 
	                        ($value{$cgi{COLLAPSE}})}

	* templates/godmode: removed euro ferret icon reference
	* templates/godmode: added value dumping, for values from 0-255

Thu Feb 27 11:58:13 GMT 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am,query.cc,docs/omegascript.txt,templates/query:
	  Added $transform{} which does regexp manipulation (currently
	  disabled); Added $uniq{} to eliminate duplicates from a sorted
	  list; Fixed a query with repeated terms to be identified as
	  SAME_QUERY not EXTENDED_QUERY; remove duplicates from terms
	  listed in term frequencies.

Wed Feb 26 17:50:26 GMT 2003  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* scriptindex.cc: Allow '_' in fieldnames.  Diagnose bad characters
	  in fieldnames better.

Wed Feb 26 15:13:02 GMT 2003  Sam Liddicott <sam.liddicott@orange.co.uk>

	* dbi2omega: Add DBUSER and DBPASSWD env var support so that password
	  protected DB's can easily be used
	* add cgi paramter COLLAPSE to collapse on key values
	* Add $value{key[,docid]} support to omegascript

Wed Feb 26 09:58:01 GMT 2003  Sam Liddicott <sam.liddicott@orange.co.uk>

	* bootstrap: Fix success message when building in non-src dir
	  as configure is written to the src dir.

Mon Jan  6 12:47:55 GMT 2003  James Aylett  <james@tartarus.org>

	* scriptindex.cc: build fix

Tue Dec 24 20:12:23 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Version 0.6.4.

Tue Dec 24 20:06:47 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* scriptindex.cc: Minor tweak.

Tue Dec 24 19:58:57 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.cc,docs/cgiparams.txt: Prefer MINHITS to MIN_HITS and
	  RAWSEARCH to RAW_SEARCH since none of the other CGI parameter
	  names have _ separating words.  Also support old names for now.

Mon Dec 23 03:23:33 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc,docs/omegascript.txt,templates/query: Added $unstem to map
	  a stemmed term to the form(s) used in the query; $queryterms now
	  only includes the first occurence of each stemmed form; $prettyterm
	  uses the unstem map.

Sat Dec 21 17:47:33 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* scriptindex.cc,docs/scriptindex.txt: Replaced index=nopos with
	  indexnopos action; index and indexnopos now take an optional
	  prefix argument; index=nopos is handled specially for backwards
	  compatibility.

Sat Dec 21 17:18:02 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* scriptindex.cc,docs/scriptindex.txt: Added new scriptindex action
	  date=FORMAT to generate terms for date range searching.

Sat Dec 21 01:51:32 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* templates/query: Stop topterms sticking out of green box with
	  gecko based browsers.

Sat Dec 21 01:44:53 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am: Distribute docs/scriptindex.txt.
	* docs/omegascript.txt: It's $setrelevant not $set_relevant.

Sat Dec 14 13:54:10 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Version 0.6.3; removed -Wno-long-long as we don't use
	  long long here.
	* query.cc: Compilation fixes.
	* templates/query: Don't call $topterms twice!

Sat Dec 14 01:10:48 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Updated in line with removal of OmSettings.

Wed Dec 11 00:58:49 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in,query.cc,docs/omegascript.txt,templates/query:
	  Added $time which reports how long the match took - when searching
	  on a remote website, it's hard to gauge how much time is taken by
	  the search, and how much by the web server and browser; renamed
	  and_vec to or_vec which better describes its purpose.

Mon Dec 09 17:11:26 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc,docs/omegascript.txt,templates/query: Added $dbsize
	  to return the number of documents in the database being searched.
	  Use this in the default query template on the "front page" shown
	  when there's no search.

Mon Dec 09 02:55:46 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc,docs/omegascript.txt,templates/query: Added $msizeexact
	  which returns "true" if $msize if exact (or "" if it is estimated).
	  This means that you'll see "... of about N matches" less often -
	  notably it's gone when searching for a single term, which is a
	  pretty common case.
 
Sun Dec 08 08:42:47 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* scriptindex.cc: Replaced icky unportable code which set the filename
	  to "/dev/fd/0" in order to read from stdin.

Sun Dec 08 06:39:30 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc,docs/omegascript.txt: Fixed $hitlist to complain if more
	  than one parameter is passed; $topterms now defaults to 16 terms
	  rather than 20; $topterms now weeds out terms which stem to the
	  same as those in the query, or those already in $topterms. 

Sun Dec 08 06:36:04 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* templates/query: Make background white - the very light grey just
	  looks dirty; fixed exclusion of TopTerms Javascript when there
	  are not TopTerms; sample now <small>; language and size now
	  appear when the corresponding fields are present; fixed
	  unmatched </small>; fixed missing list of terms matching
	  each document.

Sat Dec 07 21:20:31 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Version 0.6.2.

Sat Dec 07 21:04:31 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Prefer "while (true)" to "while (1)".

Fri Dec 06 04:41:05 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex.cc: Index .php files by default; non-zero return code if
	  an exception is caught.

Fri Dec 06 04:30:17 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* htmlparse.cc: Ignore PHP tags and their contents; fixed tag
	  scanning code to never read one character past the end of
	  the document.

Wed Dec 04 18:42:51 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.cc,omega.h,omindex.cc,query.cc,scriptindex.cc:
	  Updated in line with OmSettings related changes to the API.

Wed Dec 04 17:13:43 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Fixed $dbname to return "default" for the default
	  database, rather than "" - this fixes paging in searches of the
	  default database.
	* templates/query: Removed xDEFAULTOP hidden field which is no longer
	  used.

Wed Dec 04 11:57:13 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* templates/query: Removed bogus unmatched '}'.

Thu Nov 28 20:24:08 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.cc,query.cc: Updated in line with OmEnquire::get_eset() no
	  longer taking an OmSettings object.

Wed Nov 27 19:02:12 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* dbi2omega: Return fields in table order; more efficient;
	  report any error reading a row; if we get a NULL field,
	  don't output it, and suppress perl warning about use of
	  an undefined program.

Wed Nov 27 05:22:04 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Set version to 0.6.0.

Wed Nov 27 05:21:00 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in,htmlparse.h,omindex.cc,scriptindex.cc:
	  Use "-Wall -W" rather than "-Wall -Wunused", and fixed the
	  warnings this reveals.

Wed Nov 27 04:20:13 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am,dbi2omega: Added perl script to dump any database
	  which perl DBI can access into the dump format expected by
	  scriptindex.

Wed Oct 30 02:02:32 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.spec.in: Use bootstrap instead of buildall; don't use "-j4"
	  with make - most people don't all have quad processor boxes!

Wed Oct 30 01:56:31 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* buildall: Removed in favour of bootstrap script.

Tue Oct 29 02:01:58 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex.cc,scriptindex.cc: Added MAX_PROB_TERM_LENGTH (set to
	  64) to limit size of probabilistic terms.

Sat Oct 12 17:09:55 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* bootstrap: Copied bootstrap script from xapian-core.

Sat Oct 12 17:05:37 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Version 0.5.3.

Wed Oct 09 16:55:56 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.cc,omega.h,query.cc,docs/{cgiparams.txt,omegascript.txt},
	  templates/query: revamped the "reset first page when filter changes"
	  scheme - all filtery things are now serialised and put into the
	  xFILTER CGI parameter, which copes with multiple B values.  Support
	  for the old way (xB, xDATE1, xDATE2, xDAYSMINUS, xDEFAULTOP) is
	  included for now (but only copes with a single B value).  Added (and
	  documented) $filters Omegascript command to implement this.
	* query.cc: fixed handling of case when topdoc is non-zero, but
	  no matches were found.  This was causing topdoc to be set to -6!
	* query.cc: fixed handling of prefixes starting with an X.

Wed Oct 09 15:35:54 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* .cvsignore: Added scriptindex and omega-*.tar.gz; removed libtool.

Sun Oct 06 18:56:40 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Version 0.5.2.

Thu Oct 03 16:42:06 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc: Added CMD_hit to enumeration.

Wed Oct 02 17:02:25 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Version 0.5.1.
	* Makefile.am,configure.in: require automake 1.6.3 and autoconf 2.54
	  since xapian-core does anyway, and it neatens configure.in slightly.            
Wed Oct 02 16:58:39 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* query.cc,docs/omegascript.txt: Added $hit which gives the m-set
	  number of the current hit.

Sun Sep 22 15:47:33 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configfile.cc: Corrected use of string.data() to string.c_str().

Sun Sep 22 03:53:35 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* templates/query: Updated xapian url to http://www.xapian.org/

Fri Sep 20 15:36:35 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* configure.in: Version 0.5.0.

Sun Sep 15 03:07:31 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard.boulton@omsee.com>

	* buildall: Update to latest version, to fix bug with VPATH version
	  checking for autoconf.

Thu Sep 12 15:11:16 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* htmlparse.cc: Add comment about string::replace() invalidating
	  iterators.

Thu Sep 12 13:38:05 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omegascript.vim,omegascript.txt,query.cc: cosmetic tweaks.

Thu Sep  5 14:47:54 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* configure.in: Don't use libtool.  I don't know why I ever thought
	  it was needed.

Thu Sep  5 14:11:51 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* query.cc: Change $and to return true iff all its arguments are
	  not false, rather than if one or more of the arguments is false.
	* docs/omegascript.txt: Update documentation of $and{}

Fri Aug 23 13:27:02 BST 2002  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docs/quickstart.txt: encourage people to call their first
	  database 'default' since this will work straight off.

Wed Aug 21 17:52:36 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* query.cc: Add $slice{} command, to slice a list at a set of
	  positions (given by a second list).
	  Also, bugfix: require $hitlist{} to take at least one parameter:
	  it currently segfaults if given none.
	* docs/omegascript.txt: Document $slice{}.
	* extra/omegascript.vim: Update syntax highlighting.

Wed Aug 21 18:03:43 BST 2002  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* omindex.cc: tidy up output so it doesn't wrap so much

Wed Aug 21 18:01:38 BST 2002  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* htmlparse.cc: fixed bug in entity reference handling

Wed Aug 21 13:21:12 BST 2002  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* omindex.cc: Bugfix to metaterm generation when operating on an
	  absolute URL that is also at the root of its web server.

Wed Aug 21 10:48:06 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* scriptindex.cc: If a field has multiple instances, keep all of
	  them (previously only kept the final occurrence).
	* docs/scriptindex.txt: Mention that multiple instances of fields
	  are permitted.

Tue Aug 20 18:02:45 BST 2002  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docs/quickstart.txt: correct for new(ish) omindex behaviour

Sat Aug 17 13:38:57 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* extra/omegascript.vim: Quick attempt at a vim syntax highlighting
	  file for omegascript.  Recognises files only if they're in a
	  directory called "templates": perhaps we should adopt a suffix to
	  make recognition easier.
	  Read the file for installation instructions.

Thu Aug 15 11:21:20 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* scriptindex.cc: Allow updating of databases by a command line
	  switch, and also turn off verbose output (can be turned back
	  on with a switch).
	* docs/scriptindex.txt: Document the "unique" tag.

Thu Aug 15 11:18:21 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* buildall: Copy buildall from xapian-core - the old one breaks
	  for me (due to odd aclocal paths) but the new one is fine.
	  We should make a common module to hold build stuff to be shared
	  between modules, though.

Mon Aug 12 01:34:42 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* scriptindex.cc: Bug fix - index without positional information
	  if "nopos" is specified, rather than the other way around.
	  Bug fix - don't completely eradicate newlines in multiline values,
	  until they have a chance to be converted to spaces.
	  Delete documents if no fields other than unique fields are
	  specifed.
	  Add some simple debugging, and write messages to a log file in
	  the database directory.

	* configure.in: Use libtool.

Fri Aug  9 13:57:32 BST 2002  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* scriptindex.cc: Fix compile errors, by changing string
	  constructors to take begin and end iterators, instead of a begin
	  and a length.

Fri Jul 05 19:33:55 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.spec.in: Fixed wrt /usr/lib/omega/bin/omega.

Fri Jul 05 19:20:05 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Makefile.am, docs/quickstart.txt: Install omega as
	  ${prefix}/lib/omega/bin/omega.

Thu Jul 04 02:11:46 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* scriptindex.cc, docs/scriptindex.txt: new indexer - indexing
	  behaviour is controlled by a simple but powerful script.

	* Makefile.am: tidied up.
	
	* configfile.cc, docs/quickstart.txt: database and templates default to
	  being in /var/lib/omega rather than /home/omega.
 
	* docs/quickstart.txt: describe the new test mode (command line) rather
	  than the old one (stdin).

	* omega.cc, docs/cgiparams.txt: If xP isn't set, honour paging and
	  R-set.  So RAW_SEARCH now only disables snapping TOPDOC to a multiple
	  of HITSPERPAGE.

	* query.cc: "using namespace std;"

Fri Jun 14 00:07:20 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $prettyterm{} no longer adds a trailing '.' if the term also exists
	  with an R prefix and stems to itself.

Fri Jun 14 00:02:16 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* MORELIKE can now take a termname - this allows MORELIKE to be used
	  with a unique id from an external database if it has been indexed
	  as a boolean term.

Thu Jun 13 00:01:11 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega.conf: removed trailing slashes from directory names.

	* query.cc: removed extra slash added to template_dir; improved
	  reporting of errors opening template file.

Wed Jun 12 23:51:11 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added an alternative test mode - you can now pass parameters as
	  command line arguments, which is more convenient for repeating
	  the same test query, and for automated testing, e.g.:
	  
	    omega 'P=information retrieval' DB=papers
	  
	  If the first parameter starts with a "-" and doesn't contain an
	  "=", omega now outputs the version string and stops (to gracefully
	  handle "omega --version" and "omega --help".

Wed Jun 12 23:39:20 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex.cc: removed OLD_PREFIXES code - shout if you were using it.

Fri May 17 14:09:25 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Pass the database to the query parser (not used there at present,
	  but will allow wildcarded searches, etc to be implemented).

Thu May 16 17:57:34 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* <algo.h> -> <algorithm>.

Thu May 16 15:41:14 BST 2002  Sam Liddicott <sam@ananova.com>

	* Removed extra package again!

	* Moved images to /var/www/icons/omega till we think of something
	  better.  Should be the most harmless solution that still works
	  without requireing too much brains on the part of the installer

Thu May 16 14:53:54 BST 2002  Sam Liddicott <sam@ananova.com>

	* Moved images to a seperate optional package to stop touching 
	  user's web tree until we work out what to do.  sysadmin can
	  still install images if he wants and on a redhat box they will
	  end up in the right place. This will no doubt get revisted later,
	  that's fine by me.

Thu May 16 13:31:27 BST 2002  Sam Liddicott <sam@ananova.com>

	* Added loads more missing files like images and templates to the
	  package

	* Also fixed the templates to use the new images dir (if they used
	  images, which they actually don't)

Thu May 16 12:56:55 BST 2002  Sam Liddicott <sam@ananova.com>

	* Fixes to spec file to add various missing files

Wed May 15 12:59:37 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex now understand acronyms (N.A.T.O. E.T ...).

	* $html_highlight{} now understands "&" (AT&T M&S ...) and
	  acronyms.

Tue May 14 13:08:41 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Index <word>&<word> as a single term (e.g. AT&T, M&S, A&P).

Tue May 14 12:37:49 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex.cc: cleaned up a little. 

Tue May 14 11:24:42 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed config.h inclusion; using std::*.

Tue May 14 11:18:37 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated.

Tue May 14 11:16:03 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added SORT and SORTBANDS.

Mon May 13 12:52:29 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Autoconf 2.50.

	* Commented out omindex-config (since it's unfinished) and XML support
	  (since only omindex-config uses it).

Thu May 02 16:06:02 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated to reflect removal of OmData.

Wed May 01 11:26:59 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Changed to use queryparser in libomqueryparser.

Tue Apr 23 15:10:42 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Make buildall smart enough to generate aclocal.m4 properly and
	  remove acinclude.m4.  It now also extracts the package name from
	  configure.in so we can use the same buildall everywhere; fixed
	  problem with double use of AM_CXXFLAGS in Makefile.am.

Tue Apr 23 14:27:29 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated for xapian-config and xapian.m4 changes.

Thu Apr 18 14:37:05 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated buildall; minor tweaks to configure.in.

Wed Apr 17 12:31:18 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Removed references to xapian-config uninst options. 

Fri Apr 12 15:48:33 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Remove parsequery.cc on "make maintainer-clean".

Fri Apr 12 16:19:19 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Require automake 1.5.

Fri Apr 12 12:47:04 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Tweaked what gets interpreted as a phrase.

Fri Apr 12 12:44:00 BST 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed to use AM_CFLAGS and AM_CXXFLAGS.

Mon Apr 01 23:34:09 BST 2002 Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed support for decimal numeric entities (e.g. "&#246;")

	* Added support for all iso-8859-1 named entities (e.g. "&ouml;")

Mon Apr 01 15:07:31 BST 2002 Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Applied patch from "orion orion" to fix problem in HTML parsing.

Mon Mar 25 13:11:14 GMT 2002  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* More tolerant treatment of random punctuation in query.

Mon Feb  4 14:57:36 GMT 2002  Sam Liddicott  <sam@ananova.com>

	* Added support for repeated fields in document data.
	  $field{fieldname} may now return multiple tab separated values if
	  more than one instance of a field exists in the document data

Tue Jan 15 16:29:39 GMT 2002  Sam Liddicott  <sam@ananova.com>

	* Fixed date_range_filter for the case where DATE1 and DATE2 don't
	  share the same MONTH and YEAR and M## terms for intermediate months 
	  need calculating between the years.

Thu Jan 10 15:39:43 GMT 2002  Sam Liddicott  <sam@ananova.com>

	* Added $htmlstrip{} to strip out html tags

Thu Jan 10 14:34:35 GMT 2002  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* toptermsjs snippet now included inside the HEAD, so it's
	  actually legal HTML. Snippet now sets the required 'type'
	  attribute as well. (It keeps the technically illegal
	  'language' attribute because I have a sneaking suspicion it
	  won't work otherwise.)

Thu Jan 10 14:30:19 GMT 2002  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* $opt with two arguments now acts as a lookup for a $setmap
	  map. This was previously documented in a misleading fashion.
	  The new system is backwards compatible with the old.

Wed Jan 9  Sam Liddicott  <sam@ananova.com>

	* Added RAW_SEARCH as cgi param which when set stops change-search
	  detection being performed and processes rset, topdoc and page-change
	  parameters ( [ ] < > 1 2 etc etc ) anyway

	* Added MIN_HITS cgi param to request many more hits than can
	  fit on the page so we can be confident that the next few
	  consecutive pages will really be needed

	* Added xml template which when combined with RAW_SEARCH=1
	  can be very useful when searching is done from another
	  script

Fri Dec 21 17:56:02 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Namespace fixes to allow use of find and find_if on Redhat's
	  "GCC 2.96".

Fri Dec 21 17:53:59 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added quick'n'dirty interface to allow experimentation with
	  OmBiasFunctor.

Thu Dec 20 14:46:33 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Document xDB, xDAYSMINUS, xDATE1, xDATE2, xB.

Thu Dec 20 12:55:29 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Use double quotes on parameters to <BODY>.

Mon Dec 17 15:01:43 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Get rid of whitespace between hundreds and tens image in page
	  links.

Fri Dec 14 17:26:48 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Force first page of hits if DB, DEFAULTOP, B, DAYSMINUS, DATE1,
	  or DATE2 changes; also clear relevance judgements if DB changes.

Fri Dec 14 16:21:07 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Removed restriction on minimum page size (was 10) - for a shopping
	  type application with images next to each hit, 5 or fewer per page
	  might be reasonable; even one result per page makes sense for some
	  applications.

Fri Dec 14 15:37:20 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added $error to make nicer error reporting possible.

Fri Dec 14 14:49:18 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Give more helpful messages for query syntax errors in cases where
	  we can without elaborate YACC hackery.

Thu Dec 13 15:10:24 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* For image page buttons, display pages 10-999 by using 2 or 3 images.

Thu Dec 13 15:02:16 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* New operators: $div{}, $mod{}, $mul{}, $sub{}, $ge{}, $gt{}, $le{},
	  $lt{}.

Wed Dec 12 16:37:47 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated omegascript documentation.

Wed Dec 12 15:43:19 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed TOPDOC clipping.

Wed Dec 12 15:36:20 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* templates/query: Fixed typo which caused "..." to appear after
	  page buttons when it wasn't appropriate.

Wed Dec 12 15:11:23 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omega: Added stopword list (still hardcoded at present though).

Wed Dec 12 12:46:57 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex: index unstemmed terms with prefix 'R' (mnemonic: Raw).

	* omega: $topterms will now return terms with prefix 'R'.

	* parsequery.yy: fixed handling of DEFAULT_OP; "+first second" and
	  "-first second" now work; stopwording queries working (currently
	  stopword list is hardwired to just "the") - stopwords are ignored
	  when used as normal terms, but not in phrases, or with + and -.

	* templates/query: make use of $prettyterm{}.

Wed Dec 12 11:11:30 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $highlight{} now uses find_if not find_first_of (faster).

	* Fixed detection of new/old/extended query when a term occurs
	  in the query more than once.

	* Added $prettyterm{TERM} to convert a probabilistic term for
	  display to the user.

	* $map would allow more than two arguments, but ignore them.  Fixed
	  to take exactly two.

Fri Dec 07 15:59:21 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added macros to OmegaScript.

	* template/query: updated to use macros.

	* Removed specialcase to allow no-argument commands to accept an empty
	  argument list (e.g. "$thispage{}" rather than "$thispage").  The only
	  reason this was useful was to allow "$thispage{}s" which can just as
	  well be written using a comment to force the parser do what you want,
	  e.g. "$thispage${}s".

Thu Dec 06 18:59:34 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* If a stemmer is set, and all_stem isn't, only stemmer terms starting
	  with a lowercase letter.

Thu Dec 06 18:49:40 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* parsequery.yy: changed to use find_if() (faster than find_first_of()).

Thu Dec 06 17:46:37 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Base page links on estimated number of matches, not minimum.

Wed Dec 05 17:07:33 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex: minor speed tweaks.

Wed Dec 05 16:52:21 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex: further HTML parser speed-ups.

Wed Dec 05 16:31:33 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex: sped up HTML parsing.

Wed Dec 05 14:52:53 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* omindex: parsing terms from text is now twice as fast.

Thu Nov 29 16:53:45 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* NEAR phrases (e.g. "a NEAR b NEAR c") now work; removed "{a b c}"
	  syntax for NEAR phrases.

Thu Nov 29 15:25:54 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $highlight{} now allows you to specify the tags to use for the
	  highlighting.

Thu Nov 29 15:24:53 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* topdoc is unsigned so subtracting and then checking if it's < 0
	  doesn't work...

Wed Nov 28 15:45:39 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed clipping of hit page in case when there are a multiple of
	  HITSPERPAGE matches. 

Wed Nov 28 14:03:48 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added $hostname{URL}; $version output now says "Xapian - omega
	  <version>".

Wed Nov 28 13:04:46 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* docs/cgiparams.txt: Minor corrections and updates.

Wed Nov 28 13:03:40 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* If we're asked for a page of hits beyond the end of the matches, clip
	  to the last page of matches rather than the first.

Wed Nov 28 13:02:31 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* For an EXTENDED_QUERY, force the first page of hits.

Wed Nov 28 12:56:56 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Lower case terms when constructing the query (otherwise why
	  do we store them in the database that way? :-)

Wed Nov 28 12:36:49 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fettled default query template.

Wed Nov 28 12:33:52 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Request one more match than the last we want to display so we can
	  tell if the next page of hits is empty or not - otherwise we risk
	  offering a "next page" link when there are no more hits.

Mon Nov 26 16:28:00 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* --no-recurse / -l option added; useful if your sites are
	  nested in their disc storage (particularly things like
	  http://example.com/ being a distinct site, with
	  http://example.com/product being within it)

	* --mime-type now really works (it was --mime-map in the code)

	* documentation updated further

Mon Nov 26 14:39:00 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* options parsing fixed so minimised/unrecognised long options
	  doesn't segfault

Mon Nov 26 14:00:13 2001  James Aylett  <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* omindex can now index part of a site (previously 'subsite')
	  by having an index base within the site's disc storage

Mon Nov 26 13:57:10 2001  James Aylett <tartarus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Documentation updated for recent changes

Thu Nov 22 13:24:45 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Use $nice{} in query template, but don't use $freqs.  Use numbers as
	  page image button tooltips on Netscape 4.

Thu Nov 22 13:02:17 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Herded escaped CGI parameter mangling code back into cgiparam.cc;
	  added special handling for  numeric image button names.

Thu Nov 22 12:55:00 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed $nice to put the comma (or dot) in the right place.

Tue Nov 20 17:30:19 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $lastpage now returns 0 when there are no matches (previously
	  gave a very large answer).

Tue Nov 20 12:30:47 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* $terms now only returns terms which were in the parsed query
	  (boolean filter terms are excluded).

Tue Nov 20 12:07:54 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed bug in date range filtering (got it wrong when start and end
	  date were in the same month).

	* DAYSMINUS now counts back from DATE1 (if specified) rather than
	  always counting back from the present.

Mon Nov 19 17:13:24 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added date-range filtering (not fully tested yet).

Mon Nov 19 15:21:31 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed (c) message displayed by -v (BrightStation "PLC" not "Inc.",
	  first (c) 1999).

Fri Nov 16 11:49:20 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* New OmegaScript commands: $allterms{<docid>}, $freq{<term>},
	  $nice{<number>}, $set_relevant{<docid>}.

	* $map{} now returns a list (shouldn't affect most users - if
	  the extra tabs are a problem, change `$map{...}' to
	  `$list{$map{...},}' ).

	* Template `query' now preserves value of THRESHOLD.

	* Template `godmode' fixed to actually work.

Wed Nov 14 15:04:13 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed to compile with GCC3.0

Wed Nov 14 14:54:53 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated for changes to OmQuery

Tue Nov 06 13:10:15 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Updated .cvsignore.

Tue Nov 06 13:02:04 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Fixed lookup of CGI parameter THRESHOLD.

Tue Nov  6 12:38:37 GMT 2001  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* Moved configure.ac to configure.in: depending on autoconf 2.13 is
	  not needed yet.

Tue Nov 06 12:23:55 GMT 2001  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

	* Added support for percentage threshold cutoff (CGI var THRESHOLD);
	  Code for calculating better percentages has been pushed into Xapian
	  so removed it from here.

Mon Nov  5 12:42:26 GMT 2001  Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>

	* Omega moved to new home, from om-examples/omega.
	  Standalone build system added.
