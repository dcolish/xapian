Omega 0.8.3 (2004-09-20):

* scriptindex: --version now actually reports the version.  --help now exits
  with status 0 rather than status 1.

* RPM packaging: Updated.  The most notable change is that the RPM is now
  called xapian-omega because there's already an omega RPM (in Fedora Core at
  least) which is a game.  Also htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script are now
  included in the RPM.

* Install htdig2omega.script in ${prefix}/share/omega/ rather than
  ${prefix}/share/.

Omega 0.8.2 (2004-09-13):

* omega: $highlight now handles accented characters (bug#9).

* omega: Use new checkatleast parameter to Enquire::get_mset to implement
  MINHITS.

* omindex: When running with "replace duplicates" mode (the default), detect
  documents removed since the last indexing run and delete them from the
  database (bug #34).

* omindex: Use the new WritableDatabase::replace_document(term, doc) method.

* scriptindex: Report index script file name and line number when
  reporting errors in it.  Added warning for redundant actions,
  such as "truncate" as the last action in a rule.

* templates/query: Always report if the database is not found - previously we
  only did so if there was a query.
	  
* templates/query: Fixed missing </center> tag which happened in certain cases.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Added note about that $add{$hit,1} gives
  the "hit number".

* Now includes htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script which allow you to crawl
  remote websites with ht://dig, then build a searchable index of them with
  Xapian and Omega.

* Link with -lxapianqueryparser, not -lomqueryparser.

Omega 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

* omindex: Renamed hash() to hash_string() to avoid colliding with something
  on IRIX.

* omega: Changed MORELIKE to pick up to 40 terms, rather than up to 6 (feedback
  on the mailing list suggests this gives much better results).

* scriptindex: Added explicit catch for std::bad_alloc.

Omega 0.8.0 (2004-04-19):

* scriptindex: Change default to *not* overwriting the database (use
  --overwrite if you really want to do this); -u is now accepted but ignored.

* scriptindex: Use getopt for option parsing.

* omindex: Added --overwrite option which forces an existing database to be
  deleted before indexing begins.

* templates/xml: Correct spelling of `relavence' to `relevance'.  NB: if you're
  parsing the XML output, you'll need to fix this spelling in your parser!

* templates/xml: Now set HTTP header: "Content-Type: application/html".

* templates/xml: Remove unused OmegaScript code:
  `$set{topterms,$or{$ne{$msize,0},$query}}'.

* indextext.cc,omindex.cc,scriptindex.cc: Updated to use add_term() instead of
  add_term_nopos().

* omega: Added $httpheader Omegascript to allow arbitrary HTTP headers and
  alternative Content-Type headers to be specified.

* omega: If the probabilistic query was bad, don't try to run the match.

* omega: Don't crash if there's a date filter but no probabilistic query.

* omindex/scriptindex: Raw terms with a multicharacter prefix are now indexed
  with a : inserted (e.g. as XFOO:Rterm).  This matches what the query parser
  does.

* omindex/scriptindex: Don't create R terms for terms which start with a digit.

* omindex: Use O_STREAMING and/or posix_fadvise() when reading files to be
  indexed (if available).  This helps to keep the Xapian database in cache,
  and should greatly improve indexing throughput.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Make more explicit that boolean produces a *single*
  boolean term.

* docs/cgiparams.txt: Note that START and END should be in the format YYYYMMDD.
