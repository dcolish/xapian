Omega 0.8.0 (2004-04-??):

* scriptindex: Change default to *not* overwriting the database (use
  --overwrite if you really want to do this); -u is now accepted but ignored.

* scriptindex: Use getopt for option parsing.

* omindex: Added --overwrite option which forces an existing database to be
  deleted before indexing begins.

* templates/xml: Correct spelling of `relavence' to `relevance'.  NB: if you're
  parsing the XML output, you'll need to fix this spelling in your parser!

* templates/xml: Now set HTTP header: "Content-Type: application/html".

* templates/xml: Remove unused OmegaScript code:
  `$set{topterms,$or{$ne{$msize,0},$query}}'.

* indextext.cc,omindex.cc,scriptindex.cc: Updated to use add_term() instead of
  add_term_nopos().

* omega: Added $httpheader Omegascript to allow arbitrary HTTP headers and
  alternative Content-Type headers to be specified.

* omega: If the probabilistic query was bad, don't try to run the match.

* omega: Don't crash if there's a date filter but no probabilistic query.

* omindex/scriptindex: Raw terms with a multicharacter prefix are now indexed
  with a : inserted (e.g. as XFOO:Rterm).  This matches what the query parser
  does.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Make more explicit that boolean produces a *single*
  boolean term.

* docs/cgiparams.txt: Note that START and END should be in the format YYYYMMDD.
