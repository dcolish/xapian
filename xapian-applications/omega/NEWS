Omega 0.9.4 (2006-02-21):

documentation:

* COPYING: Updated FSF address.

Omega 0.9.3 (2006-02-16):

documentation:

* overview.txt: The U prefix (URL term) was grouped with the date searching
  prefixes, but it makes more sense to group it with the prefixes relating to
  parts of the URL (H for hostname, P for path, etc).

* overview.txt: Add pointer to documentation of the supported query syntax.

* omegascript.txt: Improve descriptions of $cgi, $collapsed, $value, $version.

* termprefixes.txt: Fix typo.

indexers:

* omindex: add --preserve-nonduplicates / -p option to not delete any documents
  that aren't updated, in replace duplicates mode (so that multiple runs of
  omindex on different subsites don't stomp on each other).

* omindex,scriptindex: Add "--stemmer" option to omindex and scriptindex
  to allow the stemming language to be set.  Fixes bug#11.

* omindex,scriptindex: More consistent --help and --version output.

* omindex: Add support for OpenDocument format mimetypes and extensions out of
  the box.  Previously you could index them but had to pass a "-m" option for
  each OpenDocument filename extension you wanted to handle.

* scriptindex: The "-q" option no longer actually controls anything.  Just
  ignore it for backwards compatibility (and don't document it in --help).

omega:

* If executing an OmegaScript command causes a Xapian exception to be thrown,
  catch it and copy the error message into error_msg (which is read by the
  $error command).  This allows such errors to reported in a nicer way.

* Added "SORTREVERSE" CGI parameter which allows the sort order to be reversed
  when sorting on a value.  Removed "SORTBANDS" CGI parameter since it no
  longer does anything.
 
* Added	$find{LIST,STRING} to return the subscript of the first occurence of
  string STRING in list LIST.

* Added $lookup{CDBFILE,KEY} OmegaScript command to perform a lookup in a CDB
  file.

* Added new feature which allows you to avoid storing fieldnames in every
  document.  Instead you just store the field values, one per line, and add
  something like "$set{fieldnames,$split{caption sample url}}" to the
  OmegaScript template to specify the fieldnames to use.  This can save a lot
  of disk space for a large database.

* Add new "$split{}" OmegaScript command which splits a string to give an
  OmegaScript list.

* Fix $url{} to escape "+" to "%2b".  Also fix encoding of top-bit-set
  characters on platforms where char is signed by default.

* Speed up $highlight{} - only compare terms which are the same length.

* Reduce memory usage if a lot of documents are marked as relevant.

templates:

* query: Make the page title shorter so there's more chance it will fit on icon
  bars, etc.

* opensearch: Add missing escaping.

* godmode: If a non-existent docid is specified, report the error and prompt
  the user to enter another docid.  Fixes bug#60.

portability:

* omega: Fix printf type mismatch on 64 bit platforms.

* omega: Cast time_t to unsigned long to avoid problems on 64bit platforms.

* Use snprintf where available.

* Write top-bit set characters using \xXX notation to avoid warnings from
  Intel's C++ compiler.

Omega 0.9.2 (2005-07-15):

* omega: Changed $highlight so if OPEN and CLOSE aren't specified, they default
  to highlighting each word from the query with a different background colour
  like gmane does (previous default was to use '<strong>' and '</strong>').

* omega: Call QueryParser::set_database() as this is now used to decide what to
  do for terms like "C#".

* omega: Added the ability to set boolean prefixes for the QueryParser by
  setting a "boolprefix" map in the omegascript template.

* omega: Added $length{} and $stoplist{} commands to OmegaScript.

* scriptindex: Fix infinite loop if there's no newline at the end of a dumpfile.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Explain how to use termprefixes with scriptindex and
  omega, since that's what most people will want to know.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Use standard "S" prefix for title in example for
  $setmap, rather than "XT".

Omega 0.9.1 (2005-06-06):

* Releases are now created using libtool 1.5.18 and automake 1.9.5.

* Updated RPM packaging.

Omega 0.9.0 (2005-05-13):

* Updated for 0.9.0 API changes.

* omindex/scriptindex: Generate terms like "c#".

* Added mbox2omega script which allows a mail folder to be indexed using
  scriptindex.  Mostly it's an example as there's no mechanism included to show
  the full original message.

omega:

* The configuration file is now looked for differently - you can now set 
  the environmental variable OMEGA_CONFIG_FILE.  See docs/overview.txt for
  details.

* $highlight can now highlight terms like "C#".

* Add new template 'opensearch' to implement basic opensearch feeds of search
  results.

omindex:

* URL hashing previously depended on sizeof(long) so databases weren't totally
  portable between platforms.  This is now fixed, but to do so we've had to
  break compatibility with databases built on platforms with 64 bit longs
  with URLs > 228 bytes.

* Removed useless "DUPE_duplicate" option.

* Added support for indexing Perl "pod" documentation using pod2text.

* Replaced -l/--no-recurse with -l/--depth-limit which takes an argument
  allowing recursion to be restriction to any depth, not just 0 or infinity!

* Extend -M/--mime-type to allow an existing mapping to be removed by omitting
  the type.

* Fixed code so that we get lstat() prototype on Linux systems where we have
  posix_fadvise().

scriptindex:

* Improved handling of extra blank lines in dump file.

* Strip multiple \r characters from end of line.

* Complain if a dump file doesn't appear to have been = escaped correctly.

* Flush database after each input file to ensure all changes from a file
  make it in.

documentation:

* docs/omegascript.txt: Clarify $field description slightly.

* docs/cgiparams.txt,docs/omegascript.txt: Fixed 3 references to OmXxxx classes.

* docs/termprefixes.txt: Added a single document covering all aspects of term
  prefixes.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Moved $collapsed into correct place alphabetically!

* docs/cgiparams.txt,docs/overview.txt: Improved description of how B filters
  are handled when building the query.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Note that actions are applied in the specified order.

Omega 0.8.5 (2004-12-23):

* README,INSTALL: Proper installation instructions.

* omega: If an exception is thrown, make sure that the HTTP headers
  get written so that we don't cause "500 Internal Server Error".
  This problem was introduced by the change to allow a user specified
  Content-Type in 0.8.0.  Partly addresses bug#60.

* scriptindex: Fixed "Unknown Exception" when trying to "unhtml" text which
  contains "</body>" (bug#61).  This bug was introduced in 0.8.4.
 
* omindex/scriptindex: <h1> - <h6> and </h1> - </h6> now leave a space in the
  dumped HTML.  This bug was introduced in 0.8.4 - before that any tag left
  a space in the dumped HTML.

* omindex: Only try to delete removed documents in "replace duplicates" mode
  (which is the default).

* omindex: Change behaviour of crawler such that it doesn't follow symbolic
  links any more.  The new "--follow" command line option turns following of
  symlinks back on.

* dbi2omega: Add a comment to the start of the file detailing what
  dbi2omega does.

Omega 0.8.4 (2004-12-08):

* omindex,scriptindex: Improved HTML to text conversion - now we strip
  leading and trailing whitespace and convert all other consecutive groups of
  whitespace to a single space.  Also the parser now knows that some tags
  should be regarded as word breaks and some shouldn't (previously all tags
  were treated as word breaks).

* omindex: Removed bogus extra line from code which was meant to
  truncate samples, titles, etc at a word boundary, but has never actually
  worked!

* omindex: Added hooks for indexing the following formats: OpenOffice (requires
  unzip), MS Word (requires antiword), Wordperfect (requires wpd2text), RTF
  (requires unrtf).

* omindex: If a filename to be passed to a filter program has a leading "-",
  protect it from possible interpretation as an option by prepending "./".

* omega: When there's only a boolean query we promote it to be the query.
  Tweaked so we use boolean weights in this case.

* omega: Use Query::empty() instead of the now deprecated Query::is_empty().

* omega,omindex,scriptindex: Use the new Database/WritableDatabase
  constructors.

* templates/godmode: Finished off godmode template.

* Compile everything as C++.

* Check snprintf actually works - some older versions don't implement C90
  snprintf semantics.

* XAPIAN_FLAGS already links with xapianqueryparser so remove
  -lxapianqueryparser from omega_LDADD as it was causing link errors on cygwin.

Omega 0.8.3 (2004-09-20):

* scriptindex: --version now actually reports the version.  --help now exits
  with status 0 rather than status 1.

* RPM packaging: Updated.  The most notable change is that the RPM is now
  called xapian-omega because there's already an omega RPM (in Fedora Core at
  least) which is a game.  Also htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script are now
  included in the RPM.

* Install htdig2omega.script in ${prefix}/share/omega/ rather than
  ${prefix}/share/.

Omega 0.8.2 (2004-09-13):

* omega: $highlight now handles accented characters (bug#9).

* omega: Use new checkatleast parameter to Enquire::get_mset to implement
  MINHITS.

* omindex: When running with "replace duplicates" mode (the default), detect
  documents removed since the last indexing run and delete them from the
  database (bug #34).

* omindex: Use the new WritableDatabase::replace_document(term, doc) method.

* scriptindex: Report index script file name and line number when
  reporting errors in it.  Added warning for redundant actions,
  such as "truncate" as the last action in a rule.

* templates/query: Always report if the database is not found - previously we
  only did so if there was a query.
	  
* templates/query: Fixed missing </center> tag which happened in certain cases.

* docs/omegascript.txt: Added note about that $add{$hit,1} gives
  the "hit number".

* Now includes htdig2omega and htdig2omega.script which allow you to crawl
  remote websites with ht://dig, then build a searchable index of them with
  Xapian and Omega.

* Link with -lxapianqueryparser, not -lomqueryparser.

Omega 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

* omindex: Renamed hash() to hash_string() to avoid colliding with something
  on IRIX.

* omega: Changed MORELIKE to pick up to 40 terms, rather than up to 6 (feedback
  on the mailing list suggests this gives much better results).

* scriptindex: Added explicit catch for std::bad_alloc.

Omega 0.8.0 (2004-04-19):

* scriptindex: Change default to *not* overwriting the database (use
  --overwrite if you really want to do this); -u is now accepted but ignored.

* scriptindex: Use getopt for option parsing.

* omindex: Added --overwrite option which forces an existing database to be
  deleted before indexing begins.

* templates/xml: Correct spelling of `relavence' to `relevance'.  NB: if you're
  parsing the XML output, you'll need to fix this spelling in your parser!

* templates/xml: Now set HTTP header: "Content-Type: application/html".

* templates/xml: Remove unused OmegaScript code:
  `$set{topterms,$or{$ne{$msize,0},$query}}'.

* indextext.cc,omindex.cc,scriptindex.cc: Updated to use add_term() instead of
  add_term_nopos().

* omega: Added $httpheader Omegascript to allow arbitrary HTTP headers and
  alternative Content-Type headers to be specified.

* omega: If the probabilistic query was bad, don't try to run the match.

* omega: Don't crash if there's a date filter but no probabilistic query.

* omindex/scriptindex: Raw terms with a multicharacter prefix are now indexed
  with a : inserted (e.g. as XFOO:Rterm).  This matches what the query parser
  does.

* omindex/scriptindex: Don't create R terms for terms which start with a digit.

* omindex: Use O_STREAMING and/or posix_fadvise() when reading files to be
  indexed (if available).  This helps to keep the Xapian database in cache,
  and should greatly improve indexing throughput.

* docs/scriptindex.txt: Make more explicit that boolean produces a *single*
  boolean term.

* docs/cgiparams.txt: Note that START and END should be in the format YYYYMMDD.
