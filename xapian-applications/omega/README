This directory contains an index building utility and a CGI application
which uses the Xapian search library to search a collection of documents.

If you haven't installed Xapian when configuring this directory, you
need to specify the location of the Xapian code, using the
--with-xapian-uninst configure option.

This is further complicated if you are performing a VPATH build (ie,
builddir != srcdir), in which case you must also specify the location
of a built, but not installed, Xapian library, using the
--with-xapian-uninst-exec configure option.

Note that you shouldn't specify relative directories in the
--with-xapian-uninst* parameters.

Once configure has run successfully, simply running "make" in the top-level
directory should build the examples.

Developers
==========

If you are trying to build from CVS, you will need the GNU autoconf, automake,
and libtool packages.  You will also need some other packages installed in
order to provide the macros needed to build the configuration scripts.
