Basic instructions:
===================

1.      Use omindex to build an index of your website:

$ ./omindex DBPATH WEBPATH /

Where DBPATH is where you want the database, such as
/home/myuser/omega/dbs/default and WEBPATH is the directory containing
all your web documents.

2.      Edit omega.conf:

database_dir should point to the directory containing your database,
such as /home/myuser/omega/dbs, and template_dir to wherever you've
dropped the tempaltes/ directory from omega, such as
/home/myuser/omega/templates.

3.      Test omega, from the command line:

$ ./omega
omega - om-examples 0.4.1-cvs (compiled Jun 25 2001 14:55:21)
Enter NAME=VALUE lines, end with blank line
HITSPERPAGE=10
P=my search terms


You then get a large-ish HTML file. For best results, set this all up
as a CGI in some way.

For more information, see overview.txt. Descriptions of the omega CGI
program are in cgiparams.txt, and of the OmegaScript language it uses
to format its results pages in omegascript.txt.
