Basic instructions:
===================

1.      Use omindex to build an index of your website:

$ ./omindex --db DBPATH --url / WEBPATH

Where DBPATH is where you want the database, such as
/var/lib/omega/data/default and WEBPATH is the directory containing
all your web documents - e.g. /var/www.

2.      Edit omega.conf:

database_dir should point to the directory containing your database,
such as /var/lib/omega/data, and template_dir to where the templates
are - e.g. /var/lib/omega/templates.

3.      Test omega from the command line:

$ ./omega 'P=my search terms' HITSPERPAGE=10

You then get a large-ish HTML file.  This is the test mode - useful for
checking that everything works independent of your webserver configuration.
To actually use omega, you should install it as a CGI by copying or
linking the omega executable into your cgi-bin directory.

For more information, see overview.txt.  Descriptions of the CGI parameters
which omega accepts are in cgiparams.txt; omegascript.txt describes the
OmegaScript language used to control the format of omega's output.
