CGI parameters to Omega
=======================

In addition to the parameters listed here, all other parameters are
retained. Arbitrary CGI parameters may be read with the $cgi{PARAM}
and $cgilist{PARAM} OmegaScript commands.

Note that all CGI parameters are modified by Omega before they become
part of $cgilist{} - see the section at the end for details.

Main query parameters
---------------------

DB
	database name (give multiple values to search over several
	databases) each DB value may be a list of database names
	separated by "/"

DEFAULTOP
	default operator - values recognised "AND", "and", "OR", "or".
	Default: OR.

P
	probabilistic query (may occur multiple times).

OLDP
	terms from previous probabilistic query - used to decide if
	this is a fresh query (in which case relevance judgements are
	discarded and the first page of matches is shown), an extended query
	(in which case the first page of matches is shown), or an unchanged
	query.

ADD
	if present, any X parameters are added to the probabilistic
	query (used for topterms support when javascript isn't
	supported or is disabled).

X
	topterms to add to query.

R
	relevant document (multiple values separated by ".")

MORELIKE
	value is a document id to return similar pages to.

Filtering parameters
--------------------

B
	general boolean filter terms.

DAYSMINUS
	filter on this number of days up to DATE1 (if present) or
	now (if not)

DATE1
	end of date range if DAYSMINUS set; otherwise start of date
	range (defaults to 1st January 1970)

DATE2
	end of date range if DAYSMINUS not set (defaults to now)

THRESHOLD
	apply a percentage cut-off at the value given by this parameter
	(clipped to the range 0-100).

Display parameters and navigation
---------------------------------

FMT
	name of page format to use (a-z only).

HITSPERPAGE
	hits per page (integer) - clipped to range 10-1000.

TOPDOC
	first document to display (snapped to multiple of HITSPERPAGE).

If a parameter named '<' or '>' exists, Omega will go to the previous
or next results page (based on the value of TOPDOC), respectively. If
not, and a parameter named '[' or '#' exists, it will jump to the page
number given by that parameter (trailing junk after the number is
ignored). (See the section below on modification of CGI parameters to
see how this works.)

This means that <input type='image' .../> forms buttons can have names
of the form '[ 3 ]', which looks nice in lynx, for tooltips, and so
on. For text-only links, you really need to write out the entire GET
parameters and use a normal anchor.

Modification of CGI parameters
------------------------------

For an image button, two CGI parameters are passed from the HTML
client, of the form "PARAM.x" and "PARAM.y" (the x and y coordinates
within the image that were clicked).

The PARAM part of the parameters are taken from the value attribute of
the <input> element that specified that image button in the HTML
page. We regularly use image buttons to provide pretty navigation
within search results (they are part of a form because it is easier to
treat more or less all of Omega as a single form, rather than
generating very long GET requests for every button on the results
page), so Omega does some mangling of these parameters:

 * PARAM.y is silently dropped
 * PARAM.x is truncated to PARAM
 * if PARAM contains a space (the CGI parameter name, not the value):
    * the value becomes everything after the first space; the
      original value is dropped. (eg: [ 2 ].x=NNN becomes [=2 ])

   otherwise:
    * if PARAM is entirely numeric, the name becomes '#' and the value
      becomes PARAM. (eg: 2.x=NNN becomes #=2)
    * if PARAM is not entirely numeric, the value is copied from PARAM
      (eg: >.x=NNN becomes >=>)

Then, for ALL CGI parameters, the name is truncated at the first
space. So [ page two ]=2 becomes [=2.
