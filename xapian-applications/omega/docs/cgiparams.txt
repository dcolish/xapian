CGI parameters to Omega
=======================

Note that image button parameters of the form "<param-name>.x" become
"<param-name>", and "<param-name>.y" are silently dropped.

In addition to the parameters listed here, all other parameters are
retained. Arbitrary CGI parameters may be read with the $cgi{PARAM}
and $cgilist{PARAM} OmegaScript commands.

Main query parameters
---------------------

DB
	database name (give multiple values to search over several
	databases) each DB value may be a list of database names
	separated by "/"

DEFAULTOP
	default operator - values recognised "AND", "and", "OR", "or".
	Default: OR.

P
	probabilistic query (may occur multiple times).

OLDP
	terms from previous probabilistic query - used to decide if
	this is a fresh query, in which case relevance judgements are
	discarded.
B
	boolean filter terms.

X
	topterms to add to query.

ADD
	if present, any X parameters are added to the probabilistic
	query (used for topterms support when javascript isn't
	supported or is disabled).

R
	relevant document (multiple values separated by ".")

MORELIKE
	value is a document id to return similar pages to.


Display parameters and navigation
---------------------------------

FMT
	name of page format to use (a-z only).

HITSPERPAGE
	hits per page (integer) - clipped to range 10-1000.

TOPDOC
	first document to display (snapped to multiple of HITSPERPAGE).

If no TOPDOC parameter is found, but a parameter named '<' or '>'
exists, Omega will go to the previous or next results page,
respectively. If not, and a parameter named '[' exists, it will jump
to the page number given by that parameter (trailing junk after the
number is ignored).

If that doesn't exist, a parameter starting with '[' will have the
next part of the parameter name treated as the number of the page to
jump to.

This means that <input type='image' .../> forms buttons can have names
of the form '[ 3 ]', which looks nice in lynx, for tooltips, and so
on. For text-only links, you really need to write out the entire GET
parameters and use a normal anchor.
