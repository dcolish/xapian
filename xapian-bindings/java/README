How to run the examples:
========================

To run the examples, you need to give Java a special system-property named
"java.library.path".  The value of this property is the absolute path of the
directory where the libxapian_jni.so library is located.

Alternatively, you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and skip
the -Djava.library.path setting for java.

 java -classpath built/xapian_jni.jar:. -Djava.library.path=built \
      org.xapian.examples.SimpleIndex ./test.db index words like java

 java -classpath built/xapian_jni.jar:. -Djava.library.path=built \
      org.xapian.examples.SimpleSearch ./test.db index words like java
