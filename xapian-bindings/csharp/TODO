TODO
----

Write examples (copying those from other bindings).

Write documentation.


The following problems, reported by Olly, need to be looked at:

> I get a warning when building the assembly that
> WritableDatabase.get_description() needs to be marked new as it hides
> Database.get_description().  I guess that's a C# thing (probably
> something like virtual in C++).  Sounds like a SWIG bug.

> Methods like Document::add_term() with optional parameters insist on
> having all parameters specified (another SWIG bug?)

SWIG 1.3.23 apparently implements optional parameters for C#.
