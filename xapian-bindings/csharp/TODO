TODO
----

Write examples (copying those from other bindings).

Write documentation.


The following problems, reported by Olly, need to be looked at:

> I get a warning when building the assembly that
> WritableDatabase.get_description() needs to be marked new as it hides
> Database.get_description().  I guess that's a C# thing (probably
> something like virtual in C++).  Sounds like a SWIG bug.

> Also, I can't persuade SmokeTest.cs to call inmemory_open.

> Methods like Document::add_term() with optional parameters insist on
> having all parameters specified (another SWIG bug?)

SWIG 1.3.23 apparently implements optional parameters for C#.

> And the bits of SmokeTest.cs which actually compile fail with an
> exception.  Not sure what exception.  I'd had enough by that point
> and gave up before figuring out how to catch and report them.
