Description: Xapian search engine interface for Python (@PYTHON_VERSION@.x)
 This package provides Xapian python bindings built for Python @PYTHON_VERSION@.x.
 .
 The Xapian search engine library is designed to be a highly adaptable toolkit
 to allow developers to easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to
 their own applications.  It implements the probabilistic model of information
 retrieval, and provides facilities for performing ranked free-text searches,
 relevance feedback, phrase searching, boolean searching, stemming, and
 simultaneous update and searching. It is highly scaleable, and is capable of
 working with collections containing many millions of documents.
 .
 The Xapian python bindings provide an interface to the Xapian library from the
 Python programming language, allowing both indexing and retrieval operations.
