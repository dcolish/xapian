  * debian/po/: Added newly translated debconf messages for de, ru.
    (Closes: #412250, #412274).

xapian-bindings (0.9.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Fix how we determine the phpapi version to depend on.
    The previous way was technically wrong, but got the right answer
    for Debian unstable, and for Ubuntu dapper and edgy (Debian sarge was
    wrong though).

xapian-bindings (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Build tcl and ruby bindings in the same build tree to save
    a bit of diskspace and time during the build.
  * debian/rules: Fix the incorrect "Conflicts:" and "Replaces:" we generate
    for the old "per-version" Python packages (broken in 0.9.8-1).
  * debian/patch: Patch to fix building bindings for Python 2.5 on amd64
    (needed for the Ubuntu etch and any other Debian derived distros with
    Python 2.5).

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri, 10 Nov 2006 04:03:28 +0000

xapian-bindings (0.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Add no-op "binary-indep" target (Closes: #395761).
  * debian/rules: Don't try to build PHP bindings on hurd-i386 (PHP hasn't
    been ported, but Python, Tcl, and Ruby have).
  * debian/rules: Upstream no longer support Python 2.1 bindings so update
    comments regarding the Python versions supported by the sarge backport.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Add "Suggests: xapian-doc" since
    the xapian-core documentation is useful reading for people developing
    using xapian-bindings.
  * debian/rules: Use python-all-dev where we can.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sat,  4 Nov 2006 22:02:05 +0000

xapian-bindings (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in,debian/rules: Build dependency on libxapian-dev
    should be versioned (Closes: #392537).
  * debian/rules: Don't include Python 2.1 support in the stable backport
    since SWIG generates bad code for it at present.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Thu, 12 Oct 2006 14:36:43 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Fix typo in configure invocation for Tcl so that we only
    build the Tcl bindings in that source tree.
  * debian/rules: Build-Depends on phpN-cli so that we can run "make check".
  * debian/po/: Added newly translated debconf messages for fr, cs, pt, sv
    (Closes: #380341, #382933, #383396, #387533).

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Wed, 11 Oct 2006 19:09:35 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/copyright: Add Java bindings copyrights and licences.
  * debian/rules: Run "make check" on each of the built bindings.  It's a very
    lightweight test but will at least ensure that the basics work.  It also
    serves to check the core library is working - xapian-core's own testsuite
    is probably too slow to justify devoting autobuilder time to.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Remove "designed to be" from the
    package description at Wookey's suggestion.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sun, 09 Jul 2006 01:31:02 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Since the python packaging change we no longer have any
    "Architecture: all" packages to build so remove the binary-indep target.
  * Fix prerm file comments which said "postinst".
  * debian/copyright: Update with a thorough list of copyrights and licences.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 16:16:37 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tweak description and add "Homepage: http://www.xapian.org/".
  * tclxapian package wasn't depending on the tcl interpreter due to a typo
    in debian/rules.
  * libxapian-ruby1.8 package wasn't depending on the ruby interpreter due to
    a typo in debian/rules.
  * Update python packages to follow new python packaging policy.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri, 16 Jun 2006 04:09:49 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip checks for nostrip in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, so we don't need to.
  * configure with --disable-depending-tracking to reduce build time and
    space requirements a little.
  * Fix debian/control generation not to leave a partial file if interrupted.
  * Add packages for the Ruby bindings, built for Ruby 1.8.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 02:33:10 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * "Standards-Version: 3.7.2" - no changes required.
  * Debian unstable no longer includes Python 2.1 or 2.2, so don't package
    Python bindings for them (backports can easily reenable them.)
  * Add packages for the TCL bindings (which should work with any Tcl version
    from 8.1 onwards.)
  * We no longer need to change the permissions of xapian.py and xapian.pyc
    as they are now set correctly by the upstream "make install".
  * Add "python" to "Build-Depends" so that dh_python works and also to
    workaround a broken configure test for PYTHON_PATHSEP which uses "python"
    instead of "$PYTHON" so PYTHON_PATHSEP is empty if there's no "python"
    in the path.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Mon, 15 May 2006 21:11:41 +0100
  
xapian-bindings (0.9.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * PHP bindings packages now have the correct "Depends:" and are able to
    automatically modify php.ini upon installation (using debconf to ask if
    this should be done) and removal.
  * dh_python automatically generates the xapian-python->xapian-python2.X
    dependency for us, so remove the PYTHON_VERSION_MAIN mechanism (which
    wasn't actually being used anyway!)

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Wed, 12 Apr 2006 19:03:23 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added packages for PHP bindings (for both PHP4 and PHP5).
  * Don't install .py wrapper as executable (fixes Lintian warning).
  * dh_install with --fail-missing intead of just --list-missing.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sun,  9 Apr 2006 19:54:03 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * "Standards-Version: 3.6.2" - no changes required.
  * debian/copyright: Update FSF address and give download URL for releases
    instead of obsolete CVS location.
  * debian/rules: When generating debian/control, die if the python package
    isn't installed (since we require it to discover the default python
    version).
  * debian/rules: Simplify configure invocation by taking advantage of the
    change to handling of --with-XXX options in 0.9.3.
  * debian/rules: Increase DH_COMPAT from 3 to 4.
  * debian/TODO: No point planning to package guile right now!
  * debian/rules: Generate bindings package for Python 2.1.
  * New maintainer.

xapian-bindings (0.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Temporarily disable python 2.1 packages, since tarball seems to be
    broken for them.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 15 Jun 2005 11:16:19 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

xapian-bindings (0.8.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Read value of $COMPONENT from a file, rather than the
    environment, so that it is the same whenever we re-run.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 30 Jun 2004 14:21:20 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.8.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Build appropriate python versions depending on enviornment
    variable "$COMPONENT", set in my build script.  Remove dependencies on
    debian/control, so that it is only generated when explicitly requested
    by build script.

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Wed, 30 Jun 2004 13:28:43 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.8.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Richard Boulton <richard@tartarus.org>  Tue, 29 Jun 2004 15:13:50 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.8.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split debian/control into debian/control.in and debian/control-python.in
