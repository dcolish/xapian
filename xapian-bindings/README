Supported Languages
-------------------

Bindings for the following languages should be fully functional and ready
for real world use:

Java		Java bindings (built using JNI) contributed by Eric B. Ridge.
		These are currently missing wrappers for API changes in Xapian
		0.8.2 and later.
Perl		Perl XS bindings contributed by Alex Bowley are available
		from CPAN (module Search::Xapian).
PHP4		Requires PHP 4.
Python		Requires Python 2.1 or later.
Tcl		Requires Tcl 8.1 or later.

Adding support for other programming languages
----------------------------------------------

Many languages can be done using SWIG, and it's probably easier to do so
even though some languages may have better tools available just because it's
less overall work.

People have contributed XS bindings for Perl, and JNI for Java, so we may as
well keep using those, at least while they're supported for us.

What's really needed is someone interested in bindings for a particular
language who knows that language well and will be using them actively.
We can help with the Xapian and SWIG side, but without somebody who knows
the language well it's hard to produce a solid, well tested set of bindings
rather than just a token implementation...

These are languages which SWIG supports and which people have done some work
on producing Xapian bindings for:

Guile		rm@fabula.de is working on reviving these
C#		Supported by SWIG 1.3.18 onwards
                richard@tartarus.org is working on these

These are the other languages which SWIG supports, but which nobody has
worked on producing Xapian bindings for:

Ruby		Supported by SWIG 1.3.6 onwards
Mzscheme	Supported by SWIG 1.3.6 onwards
Ocaml		Supported by SWIG 1.3.14 onwards
Pike		Supported by SWIG 1.3.14 onwards
Chicken		Supported by SWIG 1.3.18 onwards
Allegro CL	Supported by SWIG 1.3.22 onwards
Modula-3	Supported by SWIG 1.3.22 onwards

Q		See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.programming.swig/5248
JavaScript	See http://www.ultravioletconsulting.com/projects/swigjs/
                (Appears to have seen no activity for over 5 years!)
Eiffel		See http://efsa.sourceforge.net/archive/cozzi/swigeiffel.htm
                (Appears to have seen no activity in nearly 6 years!)

It may be possible to support a language which isn't listed above, but it's
likely to be more work unless you're already familiar with the tools available
for wrapping a C++ library for use with that language.
