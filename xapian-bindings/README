Adding support for other languages

Many languages can be done using SWIG, and it's probably easier to do so
even though some languages may have better tools available just because it's
less overall work.

We have contributed XS bindings for Perl, and JNI for Java, so we may as well
keep using those, at least while they're supported for us.

What's really needed is someone interested in bindings for a particular
language who knows that language well and will be using them actively.
That way we get a solid, well tested set of bindings rather than just a
token implementation...
