Adding support for other languages
----------------------------------

Many languages can be done using SWIG, and it's probably easier to do so
even though some languages may have better tools available just because it's
less overall work.

People have contributed XS bindings for Perl, and JNI for Java, so we may as
well keep using those, at least while they're supported for us.

What's really needed is someone interested in bindings for a particular
language who knows that language well and will be using them actively.
That way we get a solid, well tested set of bindings rather than just a
token implementation...

These are the other languages which SWIG supports.  It may be possible to
support a language which isn't listed here, but it's likely to be more work.
