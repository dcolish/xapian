See INSTALL for instructions on configuring, building, and installing this
software.  See TODO for the to-do list.  See HACKING for information relevant
to anyone wanting to do development work on the bindings.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Most development work has been done on Linux with GCC, but the bindings should
work on other Unix-like platforms and with other compilers (we've heard success
stories for at least MacOS X and OpenBSD, and the tinderbox builds pass "make
check" on FreeBSD and NetBSD).

The Python bindings have been successfully built on Microsoft Windows using
mingw and MSVC.  The other bindings may need a few build tweaks to work -
contact us via the mailing lists if you want to get them working.

Supported Languages
-------------------

Bindings for the following languages should be fully functional and ready
for real world use:

Java		Java bindings (built using JNI) contributed by Eric B. Ridge.
		See java/README for Java binding specific information.
Perl		Perl XS bindings contributed by Alex Bowley are available
		from CPAN (module Search::Xapian).
PHP		Requires PHP 4 or 5.
Python		Requires Python 2.2 or later (Python 2.0 or 2.1 could be made
		to work with somewhat reduced functionality, but are no longer
		in common use).
Ruby		Requires Ruby 1.8 or later (brief tests show the bindings
		probably work with at least Ruby 1.6.8 too, but smoketest.rb
		doesn't because the test/unit module isn't available and
		apparently Ruby versions < 1.8 are no longer in common use).
Tcl		Requires Tcl 8.1 or later (Tcl 8.0 could be made to work
		without too much work).
C#		Tested with Mono C# 1.0.8 and 1.1.8 and Portable.NET 0.6.12.
		Also tested with Mono C# 1.2.3.1 - note that for Mono
		runtimes from 1.2 onwards, you need to compile with gmcs
		instead of with mcs.  Configure prefers to use gmcs if it
		is present, but you can run `./configure CSC=mcs' to prefer
		mcs?


If you're interest in getting other languages supported, see the "Adding
support for other programming languages" section in the file HACKING.
