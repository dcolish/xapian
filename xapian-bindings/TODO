General
-------

The "smoketest" is now a bit misnamed as it is rather more than a smoketest in
most cases, and also the different versions aren't in step as to what is
tested...

Try to further reduce the compiled size of the glue code and the time it takes
to compile.  Reworking exception handling made a huge difference!

C#
--

Sort out names which constants get wrapped as.

Write custom typemaps for constructing a query from list of Query objects
and/or terms.

Perhaps write custom typemaps for Enquire::get_matching_terms().

Passing string from C++ to C# and back isn't zero byte safe currently.

Sort out support for the Portable.NET C# compiler.  Currently Portable.NET
lacks strong naming support which is a problem because our build system assumes
we have it...

Ruby
----

Should we be renaming get_* methods which take parameters?

Should we be renaming set_* methods which don't take exactly one parameter?

Should we wrap the extra method Enquire::get_matching_terms()?  It seems
to rather duplicate the iterator->arrays mapping.

Merge the Xapian C++ documentation with the RDoc.
One way to do this would be to make a stub Ruby file defining empty methods
according to the Xapian API with appropriate RDoc comments for the purpose of
generating RDocs.
