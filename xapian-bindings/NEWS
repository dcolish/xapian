Xapian-bindings 0.8.0 (2004-04-20):

* README: Started collecting information on supporting Xapian from even
  more languages.

* Added configure tests to enable bindings only where the necessary tools
  are installed and have a supported version.  ./configure --without-LANGUAGE
  allows particular languages to be forcibly disabled.

* Added Xapian::Document::add_term() - the new name for add_term_nopos().

* A couple of Xapian::Query constructors weren't being wrapped - fixed.

* Added Eric B. Ridge's JNI bindings for Java.  The JNI bindings themselves
  have been well tested, but integration with the xapian-bindings configure
  system hasn't been tested at all - please alert us to any problems.

* Xapian can now be used from TCL.

* Python: MSet now provides a Python iterator.

* Python: OMMSET_* and OMESET_* renamed to MSET_* and ESET_*.

* Python: enable directors for MatchDecider, to allow subclassing in Python.

* Python: Added basic documentation, and some examples.
