Xapian-bindings 0.8.2 (2004-09-??):

Up to: Thu Sep 09 03:07:43 BST 2004  Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>

General:

* Require autoconf 2.59 and automake 1.8.5.

* configure: Added check that the bindings version matches the version of
  the xapian library.

* configure: Check if we're using GCC and only pass GCC specific warning
  control options if we are.

* configure: When running with GCC, also pass -Wno-uninitialized so the
  SWIG glue builds without warnings.

* xapian.i: Updated for Query->is_empty() -> Query->empty().

* xapian.i: Remove renaming of empty() methods to is_empty().
* php4/docs/bindings.html,python/docs/bindings.html: Removed
  documentation of renaming of empty() methods.

* README: Updated list of languages which SWIG supports.

PHP4:

* Document that the 2 argument form of Xapian::Auto::open() for opening a
  writable database is wrapped as open_writable() (bug #32).

* Include xapian version in output from phpinfo().

* Build the SWIG glue library like we build the others rather than using
  SWIG's -phpfull option.  This avoids problems with newer automake versions
  and means we can build against an uninstalled xapian library.

* Corrected documentation to refer to Xapian::DB_* not Xapian::Auto::DB_*.
  Fixed documentation of how Xapian::Query::OP_* are wrapped.

* Use special SWIG PHP ldflags when linking the PHP glue library.

* simplesearch.py now works with multi-term queries.

* php4/docs/bindings.html: Added documentation on how to install the
  PHP4 bindings.

Python:

* configure: Now checks for Python >= 2.1 which we need for __cmp__ and __eq__.

* Don't install _xapian.la and _xapian.a.

* Byte compile xapian.py to xapian.pyc and install it.

* Suppress SWIG warning about MatchDecider::operator() director discarding
  const.

* "make clean" no longer leaves "xapian_wrap.h" behind.

* python/Makefile.am,python/smoketest.py: Added a simple testcase
  to at least ensure the python bindings can be initialise and
  some simple operations work.

Tcl8:

* configure: Disable building tcl8 bindings if the tcl8.X-dev package isn't
  installed.

Xapian-bindings 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

General:

* configure: Require SWIG 1.3.20 or higher (previously was 1.3.14).

* Add "-I/usr/include" to the swig line.  This is needed when xapian is
  installed with a prefix of /usr, since "xapian-config --cxxflags" carefully
  doesn't emit -I/usr/include in this situation (because it causes problems
  with some GCC versions).

* Fixed the %exception handler to cover all the exceptions Xapian can throw,
  not just a subset.

Java:

* Removed wrappers for unused error classes which have been pruned from C++.

* Make finalize() methods of Database and WritableDatabase public so they can
  be called from by the user.

* Document Doccument.add_term_nopos() as deprecated.

PHP4:

* Make sure that PHP bindings build a module which exports get_module() so PHP
  is able to load it.

* Configure now checks that phpize can actually be run, rather than just that
  it's executable (test -x isn't portable anyhow).

* Added basic documentation and examples to PHP4 bindings.

* Rename overloaded methods and constructors.

* Add simple access to the prefixes map in QueryParser.

* Correct simpleindex ports to never generate empty termnames.

Python:

* configure: Use $PYTHON instead of python when running python to determine
  library and include paths and version number.

* Actually ship python examples and documentation.

Xapian-bindings 0.8.0 (2004-04-20):

* README: Started collecting information on supporting Xapian from even
  more languages.

* Added configure tests to enable bindings only where the necessary tools
  are installed and have a supported version.  ./configure --without-LANGUAGE
  allows particular languages to be forcibly disabled.

* Added Xapian::Document::add_term() - the new name for add_term_nopos().

* A couple of Xapian::Query constructors weren't being wrapped - fixed.

* Added Eric B. Ridge's JNI bindings for Java.  The JNI bindings themselves
  have been well tested, but integration with the xapian-bindings configure
  system hasn't been tested at all - please alert us to any problems.

* Xapian can now be used from TCL.

* Python: MSet now provides a Python iterator.

* Python: OMMSET_* and OMESET_* renamed to MSET_* and ESET_*.

* Python: enable directors for MatchDecider, to allow subclassing in Python.

* Python: Added basic documentation, and some examples.
