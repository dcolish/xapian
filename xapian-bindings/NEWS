Xapian-bindings 0.9.2 (2005-07-15):

General:

* Added wrappers for new optional flags argument to QueryParser::parse_query().

CSharp:

* Enhance configure to check that "mcs" is actually GNU Mono mcs and not
  another tool with the same name.

Java:

* Include SmokeTest.java in the distribution so "make check" works.

* Added success report for Sun java 1.4.1_01a.

Python:

* When converting a python list to vector<string> we know the number of elements
  so reserve that number in the vector.

Xapian-bindings 0.9.1 (2005-06-06):

General:

* Releases are now created using libtool 1.5.18 and automake 1.9.5.

Tcl:

* Updated documentation to include information from Michael Schlenker about how
  to delete a database object such that the destructor gets called.

Xapian-bindings 0.9.0 (2005-05-13):

General:

* Updated SWIG-based bindings to latest Xapian API

* Improve support for building the bindings on MS Windows:

  + Provide stub versions of any backend functions which are disabled in the
    library we're wrapping to avoid a link failure on MS Windows (where the
    remote backend is automatically disabled).  These stubs just throw
    Xapian::FeatureUnavailableError.

  + Add -no-undefined to *_la_LDFLAGS.

  + Use $(PATH_SEPARATOR) or Python's os.pathsep instead of ':' where
    appropriate.

  + For python, paths for finding headers and installing libraries are now
    handled so they work on MS Windows; an extra static library needs to be
    linked in too.

* Wrap the Muscat36 Database factory functions (easy to do now we have stubs
  for disabled backends).

* Don't wrap MSet::max_size() as it's there for STL compatibility rather than
  being useful functionality.

* configure: Fix all SWIG warnings and pass -Werror to SWIG so any which get
  introduced in future get fixed.

* configure: Fix version test to allow for _svn6789 suffix which SVN snapshots
  have.

* Generate SWIG bindings with SWIG 1.3.24 (except for PHP which we still use
  1.3.22 for as more recent versions don't work with methods with optional
  arguments - the arguments become non-optional!)

Guile:

* configure: Disable guile by default, as it needs more work.

Java:

* Updated to compile against 0.9.0 API.

* Added missing make rule to build SmokeTestWrap.class to "make check" works.

* Wrap optional parameters to Query(term) constructor.

PHP4:

* For PHP4, rename default Database constructor to Database_empty
  instead of suppressing the much more useful Database(const string &path)
  constructor.

* Use a blank config file when running PHP4 tests to avoid problems
  when the bindings are already installed as an extension which is
  loaded automatically in the default config.

* configure.ac: If configure can't find the PHP interpreter (as php4 or php),
  it probably just means it's not in PATH.  We only need it for running tests,
  so substitute a trivial shell script which just exits with code 77 so PHP
  tests are skipped (previously we substituted "missing" which caused the tests
  to fail).

Python:

* Added Python-style iterators ESetIter, TermIter, PostingIter, PositionIter,
  and ValueIter.

* configure: If python is found, also check that Python.h exists (it may not be
  if the python-dev package (or similar) isn't installed).

Xapian-bindings 0.8.5.1 (2005-02-23):

General:

* configure: Run compiler feature tests using the C++ compiler, not the C
  compiler.

* Allow bindings version to have an extra "patchlevel", yet still match with
  corresponding xapian-core version (e.g. 0.8.5.1 and 0.8.5);

Java:

* Added a missing .java source file and removed several unused ones.

* Fixed several glitches in the java bindings automake build system.

* Use "-Wno-unused" when compiling JNI C++ code to ignore harmless
  warnings in generated code (we were carefully passing "-Wunused"
  which is the opposite of what is needed!)

* Fixed a couple of warnings from GCJ.

* Wrapped a few missing methods added since Eric created the bindings.  There
  are still some missing methods - there's now a (probably incomplete) list in
  java/README.

* Added various useful bits of information to java/README.

* Tweaked SimpleSearch.java to be more like the C++ version.

PHP4:

* 0.8.5 was generated with SWIG 1.3.24, but PHP support is broken there so
  we now generate the PHP bindings with SWIG 1.3.22 and everything else with
  a more recent version.

* configure: Check for "php" as a program name as well as "php4", and
  fall-back to missing so the error message from "make check" is better.

Xapian-bindings 0.8.5 (2004-12-23):

General:

* INSTALL: Added non-generic installation instructions.

Python:

* Fixed bytecode compilation of xapian.py.  xapian.pyc was being generated in
  the same directory as xapian.py, but Makefile.am was looking in current
  directory when installing it.  Additionally, VPATH builds were broken.
  These problems were introduced by changes in 0.8.4.

Xapian-bindings 0.8.4 (2004-12-08):

General:

* README: Now clearly says which languages we currently support, which people
  are working on, etc.

* Instead of requiring the user to have a really recent SWIG installed, ship
  the files SWIG generates.  Disable all the SWIG rules unless configure is run
  with --enable-maintainer-mode to make sure they aren't triggered accidentally
  (e.g. by make with dodgy VPATH).

* configure: Require SWIG 1.3.22 or higher (but note that SWIG is no longer
  needed if you just want to install the bindings).

* Wrap the new Database and WritableDatabase constructors which replace
  Auto::open().

* It turns out that we do need to wrap MSet::MSet() (wrapping removed in 0.8.2)
  (for example, simpleexpand.py needs it).

* In the Query constructor which takes a vector of terms, only call set_window
  if window is non-zero.  Otherwise things go wrong if we're passed an empty
  vector.

* Second argument to Document::add_posting() isn't optional, but xapian.i
  indicated that it was.

* xapian.i: Added wrappers for Xapian::Weight and standard subclasses.
  Deriving your own weight class in the scripting language isn't currently
  supported.

* xapian.i: %name is deprecated, so use %rename instead.  This also works
  around a bug in SWIG 1.3.23.

* configure: Removed pointless probe for a C compiler - everything we compile
  is C++.

* configure: Reinstated the check that the bindings version matches the version
  of the xapian library.  It was added in 0.8.2, but accidentally removed in
  0.8.3.

* Use newly added option `xapian-config --swigflags` which (a) avoids always
  passing -I/usr/include which could cause problems if we're using a Xapian
  install not in /usr and there's another one in /usr and (b) avoids problems
  if `xapian-config --cxxflags` contains flags other than -I<something>.

CSharp:

* Richard Boulton has put together bindings for C#.  These build successfully
  with the Mono tools, but the smoketest currently fails.  Unclear if the
  problem is the bindings or the smoketest code.

Guile:

* The guile bindings now build successfully, so we've enabled the guile
  detection machinery in configure.  They're untested though (we don't
  know guile!) so success or failure reports are encouraged!

PHP4:

* Mention the example scripts near the start of the documentation, not right at
  the end.

* Remove documentation explicitly saying how we wrap Xapian::QueryParser and
  Xapian::Stem since we wrap them exactly as we wrap everything else we don't
  mention!

Python:

* Make overloaded Query(Query::op, vector<string>*, termpos) constructor
  work in Python.

* Changed examples to use the newly wrapped Query from list of terms ctor.

* Mention the example scripts near the start of the documentation, not right at
  the end.

* python/Makefile.am: Added xapian_wrap.h as a target for the rule which runs
  SWIG.

* Remove documentation explicitly saying how we wrap Xapian::QueryParser and
  Xapian::Stem since we wrap them exactly as we wrap everything else we don't
  mention!

* Mention simpleexpand example in documentation.

* Examples now report messages for Xapian exceptions.

* Removed MAX_PROB_TERM_LENGTH from example scripts which don't use it.

* Make the example MatchDecider exclude documents matching a value, rather than
  a term.  The latter is a very inefficient way to do what AND_NOT does, and we
  don't want examples to mislead like that.

* python/docs/bindings.html: Note that you can construct a query
  from a list of terms, even if you can't from a list of queries.
  Add HTML links to the examples.

* simpleindex.py: Trim spaces from the start as well as from the end of each
  line.  Simplify the loop slightly.

Tcl:

* Wrap in a tcl8 namespace "Xapian".

* Added a smoketest.

* Translated simpleindex and simplesearch into Tcl.

* Set the Tcl package version.

* Create pkgIndex.tcl so the package can be loaded in the usual Tcl way.

* Install in "xapian<VERSION>" directory in the conventional Tcl way.

* Added documentation for tcl8 bindings.

* Use the TCL_STUBS mechanism so that compiled extensions are portable between
  different versions of Tcl.  This needs Tcl 8.1, so bump the required Tcl
  version (was 8.0).

* configure.ac: Noted that the bindings can easily be compiled for use with
  Tcl 8.0, in case anybody needs that for some reason.

* Don't wrap the factory functions which return a quartz WritableDatabase as
  the destructor never gets called so changes aren't flushed and the lock file
  isn't removed.

Xapian-bindings 0.8.3 (2004-09-20):

General:

* Fixed mismatching versions of libtool used to produce configure and
  ltmain.sh.  The obvious symptom was ".so" missing from the shared object
  names.

* RPM spec file contributed by Fabrice Colin.  Currently this packages Python,
  PHP4, and Tcl bindings.

Java:

* Pass -classpath to javac to fix build problems.

* Make sure errors subdirectory is built before we try to build the jar file.

* Fixed "make install" to not give libtool error.

PHP4:

* Include PHP4 documentation and exmples in the tarball.

* Reverted "Use special SWIG PHP ldflags when linking the PHP glue library."
  change from 0.8.2 - it turns out we only need to pass these flags if we use
  swig's -noruntime option (which we don't do).

Python:

* Use swig's -modern switch for Python 2.2 and up - it gives cleaner, leaner,
  faster Python wrapper code.

Tcl:

* Don't install xapian.la.

* Improved configure check for tcl.h to work with Fedora Core 2.

Xapian-bindings 0.8.2 (2004-09-13):

General:

* Added wrappers for recently added methods: ESet::back() and
  Database::get_lastdocid(), and wrap the new optional third parameter
  to Enquire::set_sorting().

* No longer wrap MSet::MSet() - it's not of use in scripting languages.

* Wrap operator-- as prev() for MSetIterator and ESetIterator.

* Wrap Quartz, InMemory, and Remote database factory functions as
  quartz_open(), inmemory_open(), and remote_open().

* Added missing wrappers for static Stem::get_available_languages() and
  Stem::get_description().

* Wrap renamed method Query::empty() (was Query::is_empty()).

* Remove renaming of other empty() methods to is_empty() (but keep is_empty()
  as an alias for now).

* Require autoconf 2.59 and automake 1.8.5.

* configure: Added check that the bindings version matches the version of
  the xapian library.

* configure: Check if we're using GCC and only pass GCC specific warning
  control options if we are.

* configure: When running with GCC, also pass -Wno-uninitialized so the
  SWIG glue builds without warnings.

* README: Updated list of languages which SWIG supports.

PHP4:

* Document that the 2 argument form of Xapian::Auto::open() for opening a
  writable database is wrapped as open_writable() (bug #32).

* Include Xapian version in output from phpinfo().

* Build the SWIG glue library like we build the others rather than using
  SWIG's -phpfull option.  This avoids problems with newer automake versions
  and means we can build against an uninstalled xapian library.

* Corrected documentation to refer to Xapian::DB_* not Xapian::Auto::DB_*.
  Fixed documentation of how Xapian::Query::OP_* are wrapped.

* Use special SWIG PHP ldflags when linking the PHP glue library.

* simplesearch.py now works with multi-term queries.

* Added documentation on how to install the PHP4 bindings.

* Added a simple testcase to at least ensure the PHP4 bindings can be
  initialised and some simple operations work.

Python:

* configure: Now checks for Python >= 2.1 which we need for __cmp__ and __eq__.

* Don't install _xapian.la and _xapian.a.

* Byte compile xapian.py to xapian.pyc and install it.

* Suppress SWIG warning about MatchDecider::operator() director discarding
  const.

* "make clean" no longer leaves "xapian_wrap.h" behind.

* Added a simple testcase to at least ensure the python bindings can be
  initialised and some simple operations work.

Tcl8:

* configure: Disable building tcl8 bindings if the headers are missing
  (probably because the tcl8.X-dev package isn't installed).

Xapian-bindings 0.8.1 (2004-06-30):

General:

* configure: Require SWIG 1.3.20 or higher (previously was 1.3.14).

* Add "-I/usr/include" to the swig line.  This is needed when xapian is
  installed with a prefix of /usr, since "xapian-config --cxxflags" carefully
  doesn't emit -I/usr/include in this situation (because it causes problems
  with some GCC versions).

* Fixed the %exception handler to cover all the exceptions Xapian can throw,
  not just a subset.

Java:

* Removed wrappers for unused error classes which have been pruned from C++.

* Make finalize() methods of Database and WritableDatabase public so they can
  be called from by the user.

* Document Document.add_term_nopos() as deprecated.

PHP4:

* Make sure that PHP bindings build a module which exports get_module() so PHP
  is able to load it.

* Configure now checks that phpize can actually be run, rather than just that
  it's executable (test -x isn't portable anyhow).

* Added basic documentation and examples to PHP4 bindings.

* Rename overloaded methods and constructors.

* Add simple access to the prefixes map in QueryParser.

* Correct simpleindex ports to never generate empty termnames.

Python:

* configure: Use $PYTHON instead of python when running python to determine
  library and include paths and version number.

* Actually ship python examples and documentation.

Xapian-bindings 0.8.0 (2004-04-20):

* README: Started collecting information on supporting Xapian from even
  more languages.

* Added configure tests to enable bindings only where the necessary tools
  are installed and have a supported version.  ./configure --without-LANGUAGE
  allows particular languages to be forcibly disabled.

* Added Xapian::Document::add_term() - the new name for add_term_nopos().

* A couple of Xapian::Query constructors weren't being wrapped - fixed.

* Added Eric B. Ridge's JNI bindings for Java.  The JNI bindings themselves
  have been well tested, but integration with the xapian-bindings configure
  system hasn't been tested at all - please alert us to any problems.

* Xapian can now be used from TCL.

* Python: MSet now provides a Python iterator.

* Python: OMMSET_* and OMESET_* renamed to MSET_* and ESET_*.

* Python: enable directors for MatchDecider, to allow subclassing in Python.

* Python: Added basic documentation, and some examples.
